* = Fix / Change
+ = New feature / addition
- = Removal

02-OCT-17:
+ Added A-Z index of WADs!
- Removed "classical" folder, moving "erkatane" & "Nihility" to "episodes",
  and "DTWID", "D2TWID" & "DTWID-LE" to "megawads"
* Moved "Strange Aeons" from "megawads" to "conversions"

01-OCT-17:
+ Added "Mordeth" WAD page

30-SEP-17:
+ Added PortaDOOM_5YearsOfDoom package (incomplete)
+ Expanded "5 Years of Doom" section; still incomplete
+ Added Tim Willits' "The Complete Raven Series" WAD page
+ Added Maclom Sailor's "NoSun Series" & "Chord Series" WAD pages
+ Linking between pages in the same set now more intelligently handles history.
  Pressing BKSP will return to the original page number, but navigating left or
  right to a different page will now forget the jump from a different page and
  BKSP will now take you out of the page-set
* Changed `/LEVEL` to `/WARP` in play.bat to better reflect DOOM terminology

29-SEP-17:
* "Master Levels for DOOM II" combined into a single page-set.
  You can now switch between levels much more easily
* "misc" folder renamed to "people" and "olnoname" moved into
  "people\Octavarium" accordingly

28-SEP-17:
+ Pages now support alternate coloured themes

26-SEP-17:
+ Added skill level names for Heretic & Strife in play.bat
  (support for shareware and Hexen to be added in the future)

25-SEP-17:
+ Added a glossary page

24-SEP-17:
+ Added navigation titles & categories
+ Right-alignment was added to DOSmag; some minor page reformatting
* Moved "demos" folder out of "wads"

22-SEP-17:
+ DOOM3 BFG WADs are now automatically patched!
+ Added demos to Cacowards 2015
  (had to hunt these down manually)
* Fixed GZDoom-hardware being listed as a choice in play.bat when requirement
  was software only
* Fixed "InstaDoom" launch scripts

21-SEP-17:
* Improved tab handling in page formatting. tabs were changed to 4 in DOSmag,
  so the pages were reformatted to use actual tabs instead of spaces

20-SEP-17:
+ Added demo playback (`-playdemo`) support to scripts
+ Added speedrun demos on Cacowards 2016

18-SEP-17:
* Merged "iwads" & "pwads" folders into a single "wads" folder
  (there are quite a few community IWADs out there)
* Harmony & FreeDOOM were moved to "conversions"

16-SEP-17:
+ DOSmag now syncs columns between source and screen when encountering at least
  two spaces or more. This allows easy formatting of columns in the source,
  without having to manually manage spacing differences between source & screen

14-SEP-17:
+ Added a warning dialogue box when launching a URL so that you can see the URL
  and cancel if desired. No more sudden unexpected browser pop-up!

11-SEP-17:
+ Added "DOOM(4) DooM" WAD page. The WAD isn't included yet due to no
  infrastructure to properly support gameplay-only mods
* Change to play.bat to favour GZDoom-software over PRBoom+ software.
  This is a quick work-around for a compatibility issue with Alpha Accident
  that needs to be resolved more fully in the future
* "DTWiD", "D2TWiD" moved to "classical"
  Whilst megawads, "classical" will hold vanilla WADs specifically replicating
  the original DOOM style
* Some fixes to Master Levels launch scripts
* Fix in doom.bat for file paths containing spaces

10-SEP-17:
+ Add "Doom The Way id Did - The Lost Levels" WAD page
+ play.bat can now force Chocolate-Doom with `/REQ choco`
* Fixed up the UPX compression script
* "config\edit_defaults.bat" was not deleting z-engine config files correctly

09-SEP-17:
+ Added "Ludicrium" WAD page
+ Added "Aeon Deathmatch", "32in24-16" WAD pages
* Redone some of the default configs
- Cleaned out "mods" folder. Until a proper mod-loader is created,
  there's no point carrying this extra weight around
- Removed multiplayer WADs
  There's no method to simply launch a server list with a WAD filter already
  applied, so it's a waste of space to include these WADs in the package
- Removed Zandronum-3 from Cacowards 2016 bundle. Since multiplayer WADs are no
  longer being included, we do not need to ship Zandronum. Cacowards 2015 still
  requires it for Skull Dash.

07-SEP-17:
+ Added "Shadow of the Wool Ball" WAD page
+ Added "Echelon" WAD page
+ Added "Strange Aeons" WAD page

03-SEP-17:
+ Added `/SW` option to doom.bat to use a software renderer where possible.
  doom.bat no longer treats HW & SW engines as separate engines, instead
  favouring hardware rendering unless software mode is requested
- Removed ZDoom (deprecated).
  GZDoom can be launched in software-mode instead

02-SEP-17:
+ Added "Bloodstain" WAD page
+ Allow specific use of shareware files in play.bat
* Fixed "Adventures of Square" launch script

01-SEP-17:
+ Added "THT: Threnody" WAD page
+ Added "Warp House" WAD page
+ Added "Blade of Agony" WAD page
* Fixed "50 Shades of Greytall" launch script
  (software renderer must be used)
* "Singles" renamed to "Onesies"
* "Strange Aeons" moved from "episodes" to "megawads"
- Removed ability to exclude file-extensions from PWADs/files in doom.bat.
  This was becoming way too complex with the increasing number of locations

31-AUG-17:
+ Added Steam "HERETIC.WAD" & "HEXEN.WAD" detection

30-AUG-17:
+ Added "Japanese Community Project" WAD page
+ Added "Alpha Accident: Terra Nova" WAD page
+ Added "Miasma" WAD page
+ Added "Comatose" WAD page
+ Added "Elf Gets Pissed" WAD page
  (this is a Heretic PWAD)
+ Added "Absolutely Killed" WAD page
+ Added "Mutiny" WAD page

28-AUG-17:
+ Created Cacowards 2016 package
+ Added `/CMPLVL` to play.bat to set compatibility level on PRBoom+
+ Added "HERETIC" & "HEXEN" IWAD support to play.bat

26-AUG-17:

+ Added "Ancient Aliens" WAD page
+ Created first interlinks between WAD pages
* Fixed PWAD handling with Chocolate-Doom
  (requires `-merge` instead of `-file`)
* Fixed missing IWAD handling in doom.bat
* Fixed FreeDOOM launch scripts
* Moved WADs out of "cacowards\2015" and into the category folders
- Neuter current bread-crumb display until later replacement

23-AUG-17:
+ doom.bat now also checks the 'current directory' for PWADs / files
+ Added "no-limit" engine requirement to play.bat
* Finally fixed the word-wrapping / line-breaking issues
* Fixed "No Rest For the Living" launch script

=== Project was moved to GitHub ===

10-FEB-17:
+ Added PRBoom+ specific engine requirement for play.bat

09-FEB-17:
+ Added "ports\test.bat" to test-launch each engine
+ Added `/32` option to doom.bat to always launch 32-bit executables,
  even on a 64-bit system
