+ Added The Darkening E2 WAD page
* Upgraded GZDoom latest to 3.2.3

01-11-17:
* Moved asking user for skill-level from play.bat to doom.bat since doom.bat
  has better knowledge of what game / engine is being used

29-10-17:
+ Added a PSX DOOM TC package

23-10-17:
* Updated GZDoom to 3.2.1
* Updated Skulldash to Expanded Edition

12-10-17:
+ Added "Aliens TC" & "Aliens (TC) 2017" WAD pages

11-10-17:
+ IWAD, PWAD and all other files given to doom.bat are checked for in multiple
  locations, consistently. These directories are, in order of precedence:
  = The previous directory used
  = The 'current directory' doom.bat was called from
  = The PWAD's directory, if a PWAD was selected
  = The IWAD's directory
  = The base "/wads" directory
  = The engine's directory (for things like "lights.pk3")

+ Added "/DEH" & "/BEX" switches to doom.bat, removing the ability to load
  DeHackEd files from the files list. This was done for more reliable behaviour
  between engines, and for easing potential future improvements
+ play.bat updated to included "/WARP", "/SKILL", "/DEH" & "/BEX"
* Fixed broken PWAD GOG/Steam detection!

+ Added "Tantrum" & "Tantrum 2" WAD pages
+ Added "Cabal Series" WAD pages
* play.bat will no longer default to DOOM2.WAD if "/IWAD" parameter is missing.
  doom.bat will handle the default based on the selected engine
* Rewrite of doom.bat parameter handling & logic; parameters are no longer
  position dependent and instead use switches, i.e. "/IWAD" /"PWAD"
  + Added support for ".ipk3" & ".IWAD" file extensions
  + Added "/CMPLVL" support to set prboom compatibility level
  + Added "/WARP" to warp to a level number
  + Added "/SKILL" to set difficulty level
  + Added "/EXEC" to load additional engine parameters from a file;
    this prevents the permenant changing of config files by the launch scripts

- Removed separate "UPX Compress DOOM Engines" script and re-integrated it back
  into "Build.bat"

+ Expanded "5 Years of Doom" section; still incomplete
+ Added Tim Willits' "The Complete Raven Series" WAD page
+ Added Maclom Sailor's "NoSun Series" & "Chord Series" WAD pages
+ Linking between pages in the same set now more intelligently handles history.
  Pressing BKSP will return to the original page number, but navigating left or
  right to a different page will now forget the jump from a different page and
  BKSP will now take you out of the page-set
* Changed `/LEVEL` to `/WARP` in play.bat to better reflect DOOM terminology

29-SEP-17:
* "Master Levels for DOOM II" combined into a single page-set.
  You can now switch between levels much more easily
* "misc" folder renamed to "people" and "olnoname" moved into
  "people\Octavarium" accordingly

28-SEP-17:
+ Pages now support alternate coloured themes

26-SEP-17:
+ Added skill level names for Heretic & Strife in play.bat
  (support for shareware and Hexen to be added in the future)

25-SEP-17:
+ Added a glossary page

24-SEP-17:
+ Added navigation titles & categories
+ Right-alignment was added to DOSmag; some minor page reformatting

22-SEP-17:
+ DOOM3 BFG WADs are now automatically patched!
+ Added demos to Cacowards 2015
  (had to hunt these down manually)
* Fixed GZDoom-hardware being listed as a choice in play.bat when requirement
  was software only
* Fixed "InstaDoom" launch scripts

21-SEP-17:
* Improved tab handling in page formatting. tabs were changed to 4 in DOSmag,
  so the pages were reformatted to use actual tabs instead of spaces

20-SEP-17:
+ Added demo playback (`-playdemo`) support to scripts
+ Added speedrun demos on Cacowards 2016

18-SEP-17:
* Merged "iwads" & "pwads" folders into a single "wads" folder
  (there are quite a few community IWADs out there)
* Harmony & FreeDOOM were moved to "conversions"

16-SEP-17:
+ DOSmag now syncs columns between source and screen when encountering at least
  two spaces or more. This allows easy formatting of columns in the source,
  without having to manually manage spacing differences between source & screen

14-SEP-17:
+ Added a warning dialogue box when launching a URL so that you can see the URL
  and cancel if desired. No more sudden unexpected browser pop-up!

11-SEP-17:
+ Added "DOOM(4) DooM" WAD page. The WAD isn't included yet due to no
  infrastructure to properly support gameplay-only mods
* Change to play.bat to favour GZDoom-software over PRBoom+ software.
  This is a quick work-around for a compatibility issue with Alpha Accident
  that needs to be resolved more fully in the future
* "DTWiD", "D2TWiD" moved to "classical"
  Whilst megawads, "classical" will hold vanilla WADs specifically replicating
  the original DOOM style

10-SEP-17:
+ Add "Doom The Way id Did - The Lost Levels" WAD page

09-SEP-17:
+ Added "Ludicrium" WAD page
+ Added "Aeon Deathmatch", "32in24-16" WAD pages
* Redone some of the default configs
- Cleaned out "mods" folder. Until a proper mod-loader is created,
  there's no point carrying this extra weight around
- Removed multiplayer WADs
  There's no method to simply launch a server list with a WAD filter already
  applied, so it's a waste of space to include these WADs in the package
- Removed Zandronum-3 from Cacowards 2016 bundle. Since multiplayer WADs are no
  longer being included, we do not need to ship Zandronum. Cacowards 2015 still
  requires it for Skull Dash.

07-SEP-17:
+ Added "Shadow of the Wool Ball" WAD page
+ Added "Echelon" WAD page
+ Added "Strange Aeons" WAD page

03-SEP-17:
+ Added `/SW` option to doom.bat to use a software renderer where possible.
  doom.bat no longer treats HW & SW engines as separate engines, instead
  favouring hardware rendering unless software mode is requested
- Removed ZDoom (deprecated).
  GZDoom can be launched in software-mode instead

02-SEP-17:
+ Added "Bloodstain" WAD page
+ Allow specific use of shareware files in play.bat
* Fixed "Adventures of Square" launch script

01-SEP-17:
+ Added "THT: Threnody" WAD page
+ Added "Warp House" WAD page
+ Added "Blade of Agony" WAD page
* Fixed "50 Shades of Greytall" launch script
  (software renderer must be used)
* "Singles" renamed to "Onesies"
* "Strange Aeons" moved from "episodes" to "megawads"
- Removed ability to exclude file-extensions from PWADs/files in doom.bat.
  This was becoming way too complex with the increasing number of locations

31-AUG-17:
+ Added Steam "HERETIC.WAD" & "HEXEN.WAD" detection

30-AUG-17:
+ Added "Japanese Community Project" WAD page
+ Added "Alpha Accident: Terra Nova" WAD page
+ Added "Miasma" WAD page
+ Added "Comatose" WAD page
+ Added "Elf Gets Pissed" WAD page
  (this is a Heretic PWAD)

28-AUG-17:
+ Created Cacowards 2016 package
+ Added `/CMPLVL` to play.bat to set compatibility level on PRBoom+

+ Added "John Romero's Episode 1" WAD pages ("E1M4b" & "E1M8b")
+ Added "Ancient Aliens" WAD page
+ Created first interlinks between WAD pages
* Fixed PWAD handling with Chocolate-Doom
  (requires `-merge` instead of `-file`)
* Fixed missing IWAD handling in doom.bat
* Fixed FreeDOOM launch scripts
* Moved WADs out of "cacowards\2015" and into the category folders
- Neuter current bread-crumb display until later replacement

23-AUG-17:
+ doom.bat now also checks the 'current directory' for PWADs / files
+ Added "no-limit" engine requirement to play.bat
* Finally fixed the word-wrapping / line-breaking issues
* Fixed "No Rest For the Living" launch script

=== Project was moved to GitHub ===

10-FEB-17:
+ Added PRBoom+ specific engine requirement for play.bat

09-FEB-17:
+ Added "ports\test.bat" to test-launch each engine
+ Added `/32` option to doom.bat to always launch 32-bit executables,
  even on a 64-bit system
