Hell was defeated by a lone marine. But what no one knew was that there was a far greater and nigh inconceivable evil lurking beyond our realm: the Elder Gods. They saw how Hell had failed and felt it was now their time to succeed. They knew of the Doomguy's strength, and decided to attack him in the one place he's vulnerable: in his nightmares.

`Shadows of The Nightmare Realm` takes place within the dreams of the Doomguy, each one manipulated by the Elder Gods.

*Notes:

***DO NOT JUMP***
***DO NOT CROUCH***

Unbind jump and crouch before playing if you're used to using them.
No rocket jumping on purpose, either.

Mouselook is required for the last map.

This is designed for -complevel 0

Please also ensure that you have dynamic lights, 3d models, and high resolution textures enabled before playing. Bloom is also recommended, but not required.

Each map takes place in one of the Doomguy's dreams, so you lose all your inventory and your health is reset after each map.

One last thing, if you want to change levels, you'll want to do so in the console. Type "map corax##" to go to that level; I didn't use the usual "MAP##" format for the levels.
