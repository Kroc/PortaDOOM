:DID YOU KNOW...

- `Mordeth` was still not released in 2018\\despite over twenty years of development?

- After over 20 years of development, some of the planned maps\\for `Doom Millennium` were [R: finally released]?

- December 10th, 2018 marked the 25th anniversary of `DOOM`?\\...Actually, yeah, you probably did.


:PLAY IT, BUY THE BOOK

While December 10, 2018 is the 25th birthday of `DOOM`, it is also the release date of <Fabien Sanglard>'s [G: Game Engine Black Book: DOOM], which picks up where the previous [W: Wolf3D tome] left off, and delves into the technological and historical guts of the `DOOM` engine. If you are interested in `DOOM` lore and trivia, then it is required reading. Did you know <John Carmack>'s love affair with the [B: BSP tree] didn't even begin with `DOOM` but with `Wolf3D` for SNES?... but I digress.


:RECOMMEND ME A... COFFEE BREAK MAPSET
:===============================================================================

The `DBP` series, which ran for a good chunk of this past year, gave players a monthly dose of small mapsets featuring classic `DOOM` gameplay, with an emphasis on working within a specific theme. [M: Monuments of Mars], set in a series of sepiatone bases in a hellish Martian landscape, is the most free-flowing and fast-paced of the series, offering players the gameplay equivalent of flying down a steep hill on a bike. [C: Coffin Curse], by contrast, used its library/crypt theme to put more emphasis on whimsical details and atmosphere, with more treacherous and gimmick-oriented gameplay to go along with it (who doesn't love barrel-themed maps?). Either one is an excellent way to spend a lazy afternoon.


:RECOMMEND ME A... HARDCORE CHALLENGE MAPSET
:===============================================================================
$KEY:F=URL:https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/103100
[F: Flotsam] is a set collected by maxer <MrZZul> aka <Killer5> and friends (<Benjogami>, <bemused>, <Scotty>, <Nirvana>, <Archi>), offering a variety of mostly short, mostly difficult maps that will appeal to the masochists and the challenge aficionados of the community.

$KEY:3=URL:https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/sf3
After a bout of development hell, [3: Slaughterfest 3] -- originally `Slaughterfest 2013` (!) -- is out, and worth a look even for intermittent players of high-bodycount stuff. Alongside the behemoths and the demanding tests, there are shorter, snappier maps that work as effective ease-ins. Devoid of the "monotextured boxes with monsters" occasionally seen in `SF2011`, `Slaughterfest 3` is a well rounded, polished set. Just don't set out for completionism unless truly motivated; it is a full megawad plus change, and there are some very long maps.


:MINI MOD SAFARI
:===============================================================================
Every year, there's always a slew of people with gigantic projects that want to sweep everyone and everything away, but there's always a bunch of people that just wanna make something small. While often not big enough for awards, many times there's a handful of tiny mods that just make things... neat.

$KEY:A=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=59889
- [A: autoautosave] is a must-have for anyone who frequently forgets to save across long periods of time but doesn't want to resort to savescumming, automating the saving process every X minutes under Y conditions. Extremely useful!

$KEY:S=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=61742
- [S: Super Mario Agilities] is for those who like having a little more mobility options for `DOOM`, accentuating Doomguy's limited jumping and giving him the ability to leap high and even stomp on enemies!

$KEY:D=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=59887
- [D: Demon Counterstrike] is simple in idea and in execution: As you go through a level, areas you've visited will have demons and small items populate in the areas again. Backtracking will now result in surprise ambushes or equipment. Fun!

$KEY:L=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=61666
- [L: Liquidated Doom] takes `DOOM` and sets it entirely underwater, purely through _ZScript_. Perhaps the most out-there of all the modlets on this list, but it does mix things up quite nicely.

$KEY:P=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=60456
- [P: Champions] is a small and crazy-compatible enemy mod that provides variations of existing monsters without replacing them, making for nasty surprises in otherwise-normal encounters. Neat!

$KEY:I=URL:https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=43&t=61047
- For those who want to play DM maps in singleplayer, or really liked _Skulltag_'s Invasion mode, [I: Supreme Invasion] converts DM maps into pseudo-invasion maps, spawning enemies in waves to hack down the player.

:DOS BOOT
:===============================================================================
The original _DOS_ versions of `DOOM` may be buried, but they're not quite dead. 2018 saw small flickers of life for the executables that started it all. _Espi Award_ Emeritus <fraggle> has been laying the foundations for cross-port multiplayer, compatible with _DOS_ `DOOM` over the IPX protocol(!), with a long term eye towards resurrecting the classic multiplayer frontend _DWANGO_. On-again-off-again classic EXE hacker <xttl> returned only the other day with word of a new breakthrough: the ability to create a "loader" to patch arbitrary code into the _DOS_ executable. Your humble webmaster <Linguica> started his own vanilla EXE hacking hobby and managed to create a _DOS_ EXE for `Selfie Doom` that actually saves the selfies as screenshots. Watch this space in the future -- can a _DeHackEd_ 4.0 be far off?


:WHAT ARE WE STILL WAITING FOR?
:===============================================================================
Does this enormous list suggest the boundless enthusiasm for `DOOM` and its relations, or the hubris that will inevitably lead to the community's downfall? Is this the same boilerplate text as last year's column? The answer to at least one of these questions is "yes."
