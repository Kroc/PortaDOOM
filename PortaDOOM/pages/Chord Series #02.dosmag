Large quasi-castle, very detailed, definitely one of my better levels, (<Ola> would disagree:() I spent ages on this one. It is longer than I would've liked though:(

I would _not_ recommend UV for the "average player"
UV is for very good players, much harder than doom2.
(For one thing there aren't unnecessary invulnerabilitys everywhere...)

Has very cool lighting and a ton of monsters...
Enjoy!

*Base					: An alienated and psychopathic weirdo.
*Build Time				: Months of "hard" work... I didn't spend very much time on it though... Prolly altogether 40-60 hours...
*Editor(s) used			: Dck 3.61, by far the very best editor. Try it, it kicks deu's (and all the others) ass. Read the docs.
*Known Bugs				: Possibly, if you find any, email me, please!
