A level with (as always) vicious gameplay. Since I've been doing a lot of Quake lately I tried to add in a lot of cool architecture on the roof and stuff... nothing compared to my Quake levels but relative to the average doom level the architecture is pretty good. I like the look: metal2/brown96/teklite texturing scheme, a large tower/building which somehow survived the apocalypse.

I would _not_ recommend UV for the "average player" UV is for very good players, much harder than doom2. (For one thing there aren't unnecessary invulnerabilitys everywhere...)

Has very cool lighting/architecture and a ton of monsters...
Enjoy!

*Base					: An alienated and psychopathic weirdo.
*Build Time				: A week, prolly 10-20 hours, I was working on other stuff. I'm getting pretty fast. Always have been, actually.
*Editor(s) used			: Dck 3.62, by far the very best editor. Try it, it kicks deu's (and all the others) ass. Read the docs.
*Nodebuilders			: Zennode 0.92, BSP 2.2
*Known Bugs				: Possibly, if you find any, email me, please!
