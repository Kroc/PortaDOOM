^C:Cabal Series
:===============================================================================

*Cabal* is a series of maps by _Sverre Andr√© Kvernmo (Cranium)_. They were to eventually become a 32-map megawad, but when he was contracted to contribute to the [M: Master Levels for Doom II], he sent the twelve maps he had already finished for this project. Five were kept, and the other seven were later released as the Cabal series.

The protagonist in the Cabal series' story is not the usual space marine, but a cyberdemon lord betrayed by his peers and transformed into a human. Driven by the desire for revenge, he sets out to slaughter the conspirators and all those who now serve them instead of him.

The level progression would probably have been something relatively similar to this:

- [A] CABAL1	*Bloodflood
- [B] BLOODSEA	*Bloodsea Keep (Master Levels)
- [C] CABAL2	*Derelict Station
- [D] CABAL3	*The Watchtower
- [E] MEPHISTO	*Mephisto's Maosoleum (Master Levels)
- [F] CABAL4	*Temple of Death
- [G] TEETH		*The Express Elevator to Hell (Master Levels)
- [H] CABAL5	*We Who are About to Die
- [I] CABAL6	*Eye of the Storm
- [J] BLACKTWR	*Black Tower (Master Levels)
- [K] CABAL7	*The Image of Evil
