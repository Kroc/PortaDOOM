^C:10 YEARS OF DOOM :: THE ART OF DEMO MAKING pt.I

:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:A Brief DOOM Demo History
:===============================================================================
:The Beginning:
:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Before DOOM was developed,* the great minds at idsoftware had taken notice of the modifiability of their previous games like Wolfenstein3D. When DOOM was released on December 10th 1993, they proved their genius to the world for the first time. The DOOM experience is so configurable that playing possibilities are virtually endless. Out of the box, DOOM allows five skill settings, player speed modification, respawning monsters, fast monsters, IPX 4-player multiplayer, and innumerable ways to play in an unbounded gaming world. Being able to create your own levels, modify the game's engine, play single-player and multiplayer games, and replay playback demos are the key to DOOM's longevity.

Although I'm sure _John Romero_ wasn't the sole advocate of demo-support in their games, his presence and excitement during their in-house "deathmatches" exemplified the need to ensure its existence. From those sessions, the rules and dynamics of modern multiplayer personal computer gaming were born. Had this developed differently at this stage, First Person Shooters as a genre would have evolved much differently.

As with Wolfenstein, the levels were timed. This meant the game was quantifiable. Demo-support meant you could compare your times with others. One must realize that in 1994, the state of the "internet" was much different than it is today. Bulletin Board Systems and FTP sites were dominant for file storage. Can you say 9600 baud phone modem?

By the time Windows95 was released, there were hordes of DOOMers playing together in online deathmatch games. There's a famous statement that DOOM was loaded on more systems than any other piece of software!... widespread playing meant practice, practice meant competition; and the competition was intense. 20-minute one-on-one matches meant sometimes well over 100 frags; not even Quake would be this fast-paced. DOOM became the featured game of online competitions and LAN events... true PC gaming as a professional sport was born. As with Quake, the core DOOM deathmatch gameplay and dynamics would hardly change as the years progressed (outside the advent of the almighty SuperShotgun in Doom2). However, single-player would see a good amount of progression and variation.

:The Early Years:
:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first established location for friendly DOOM competition was the LMP Hall of Fame, started by _Christina 'Strunoph' Norman_. The LMP Hall of Fame's content quickly became replaced by the DOOM Honorific Titles, but the foundation that this site started was instrumental in the future of DOOM demos.

The [A: DOOM Honorific Titles(DHT)] had several incarnations. The DHT would create the basis for all DOOM demosites that would follow. Created by _Frank Stajano_ in May 1994, the DHT were designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on pre-determined maps in the IWADs. These 'exams' became very popular as you had to earn each title. People earned personal titles while the more vigilant demo watchers keep notice of the record recordings for each category on each IWAD map. DOOM2 was released on October 10th 1994, and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new DOOM version releases. At the apex of it's popularity, the DHT had players creating new categories and playing styles. For example, playing with only weapons 1 and 2 in a maxkills format became known as Tyson mode, obviously named after the heavyweight boxer Mike Tyson. Pacifist-mode was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each [B: category] had easy, medium, and hard maps for players to get randomly chosen for. The players had to perform a dance during their demo (often done at the very start of the demo) as an authentication mechanism to prevent players from submitting other people's recordings. Obviously, the skills needed to run through a map quickly were different than the skills needed to punch all the monsters to death. The varied categories created an appeal for all types of players. The demo runners were a very diverse group of people from all parts of the planet. Many legends in the DOOM demoscene would play in the DHT including _George Bell_ ([C: Tyson]), _Steffen Udluft_ ([D: Pacifist]), _Kai-Uwe 'Gazelle' Humpert_, _Frank 'Jesus' Siebers_ (Nightmare), _Thomas 'Panter' Pilger_ (Reality), _Yonatan Donner_, _Rich J. Sham_, _Jonathan 'Hunter' Hoof_, _Andreas 'Anthe' Kren_, _Adam Williamson_, and _Steffen Winterfeldt_. Unfortunately, the DHT always had trouble with a permanent internet location. This, combined with the changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, made public interest wane as the years rolled on.

The natural evolution from the varied diversity of what had come before was the [E: Compet-N]. Started by _Simon Widlake_ in November 1994, the Compet-N focused on the record demos more than the players. It is important to note that external activity was always present outside the Compet-N, whether in the DHT or elsewhere. The location the Compet-N changed over time; it was even at ftp.cdrom.com for awhile (and that archive is still available on the archive.3dgamers.com network). _Istvan Pataki_ took over as maintainer and it moved to ftp.sch.bme.hu. From there in early 1998, it juggled into the very capable hands of _Adam Hegyi_, who has been the maintainer ever since. When the Compet-N started, there was only maxkill or speed demos for individual Iwad maps or entire episodes. The early demos are somewhat silly by today's standards; for example, Map09 speedrun was done in a monstrous 15:22 (the current record is a deft 1:09 by _Vaclav 'Bolton' Kunes_). Like the Olympic Games, the Compet-N would swell and change under the weight of newer, better competitors and additional categories. A good look at one moment in time is the [F: Hall-of-fame page] from March 1997.

:Sifting out the multitudes:
:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the DHT lifespan, between 1994 and 1997, the demoscene broadened greatly as the number of DOOMers worldwide constantly decreased. Besides the Compet-N, the DOOM demoscene has always been a mish-mash of miscellaneous demos spread thinly over the internet. The lack of any centralized resource crippled the development of what could have been in both the single-player and multiplayer communities. Although many sites existed, or currently exist, featuring a few demos, locally recorded demos, personal demos, or a very confined contest. Few sites bridged the boundless internet to satiate and captivate a large DOOM audience.

Besides _John Romero_, I'd say that no one person did as much for First-Person Shooter demos than [G: Yonatan Donner]. He single-handedly revitalized interest in DOOM for the top skilled players. Co-authoring the hallmark megawad for DOOM demos, Hell Revealed, with _Haggay Niv_, _Yonatan_ showed a passion for demos both as a player and a spectator. His work with the Quake Done Quick team developed not only the first two [H: QDQ DOOM] demos but also the Tools-assisted tools. Hell Revealed was as important to the DOOM demo community as Quake.

QuakeDoneQuick does DOOM. The three QDQ DOOM movies are non-cheated single-level runs spliced together for one smooth, near-flawless demo. The excitement and production around these demos couldn't have been bigger and they didn't disappoint. Allowing both the standard first-person perspective and, for the first time ever in DOOM, a moving chasecam perspective, the QDQ DOOM demos are uniquely entertaining. Although many of the tricks have been improved since these were recorded(the first two in 1998 and DOOM Done Quicker in 2000), these gems of demo delight will never grow old.
