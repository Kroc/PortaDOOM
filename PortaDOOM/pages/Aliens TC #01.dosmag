^C*The Total Conversion


*Aliens TC* is a total conversion based on the movie Aliens, created in 1994 by <Justin Fisher>. It was the first total conversion and is one of the most famous. In the week following the release of Doom II, there was more discussion in the Doom newsgroups related to Aliens TC than to Doom II.

The Aliens TC is noted for its suspenseful atmosphere. The first level is devoid of enemies, a surprising feature considering the fast-paced action of Doom. Later on, however, the player faces the aliens and even gets to use the powerloader from Aliens as a weapon.
