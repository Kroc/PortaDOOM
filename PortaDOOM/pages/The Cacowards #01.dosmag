*Since 2004, the year following "10 years of Doom", Doomworld has marked Doom's birthday by hosting an annual award ceremony honoring the year's top releases.

Continuing the 10 Years' format, a handful of the best wads are chosen and discussed in detail, including the best multiplayer map, best comedy map, longest development time, and the mapper of the year, which honors a prolific developer in the community. Anyone looking for a collection of the greatest projects created for Doom should read through the following articles, as well as "5 Years of Doom" and "10 Years of Doom".
