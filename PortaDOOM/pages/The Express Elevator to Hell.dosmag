Ok, here's the plot: Kick Butt!
Gripping, isn't it? In case you are a little more into story-lines you can keep reading.

This and the other of my wads were to be released inside a 32-level "episode" on the internet. But having id release them is about 666 times cooler. The plot in the intended episode was as follows:

You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon to rule hell and you spear-headed the council that governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the other members you find yourself not only dismantled, but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation: You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're out for revenge and have to kick the other members of the Cabal's butts one by one.

When the "Express Elevator to Hell" starts descending the renegade Cabal has begun to realize you might be a threat to them, human or not. Half way down the shaft that should have taken you to the deepest pits of Hell, the lift first slows down before it jerks to a halt. Ambush! Survive the initial onslaught and find a gateway out of the now sealed elevator. Tough, but that's the way you like it...

*Base*                    : An obsessive personality, lotsa caffeine and lotsa nicotine. :Q A twisted mind doesn't hurt either. An additional credit should go out to those wad-designers that have inspired me greatly through their work. I don't know all their names, but the names of their WADs should suffice. Hail the hall of fame:

			  - "Nukemine" (old I know, but the supreme numero uno at it's hayday)
			  - "Castle of the Renegades".\\Best castle-type wad I've seen.
			  - "Eternity"
			  - "Dante's Gate"
			  - The secret level in the AlienDoom episode was groovy as well, and "Cleimos" had some nice touches.
                          
*Build Time*              : Don't ask, really! First baby steps at "wadding" taken in the summer of 94. Almost dropped out of university for this bloody obsession. One reason for surviving was that I handed in a wad of my campus as one of my projects. <G>

			    I would guess that I on average spend about 130 hours on each wad. And it's not because I work slow :)
                          
*Editor(s) used*          : DoomED 4, DEU2, BSP1.1, DeepBSP and idBSP.
*Bugs*                    : No way. _Shawn_ has plucked them all out and forced me to eat them. I hate you if you find some! ;)

			    Hope you enjoy the wad.

- _Andrew (& Mark) Cornes_, _Gregory "Acoma" Hyne_, _Peter "Pete" Ripley_, _David "Macca" Mccandless_, _Bjornar Johansen Johansen_, _Baard Zachariassen_ and _Stian Danielsen_ for playtesting, viewpoints, help, enthusiasm and for being mad bastards.
- Oh, and _Erling Paulsen_ for managing to convince me that there was such a thing as a full fledged Doom-editor, back in early 94. Os!
- A brand new BFG goes out to _Geoff Allan_ (DOOMed), _Raphael Quinet_ (DEU), _Olivier Montanuy_ (DeuTex) and _Colin Reed_ (BSP) plus whoever put together idBSP.
- _Shawn Green_ for including me in the project.
- Last but never least to all other WAD-designers who have lost themselves in the worlds of tag numbers, upper textures and vertexes as badly as me, particularily the other designers that worked on this add-on. Looking forwards to play your wads dudes!

*Deathmatch bad-arse credits:
