(See pages 2 & 3 to play using the "filters")

If you just can't get enough of taking pictures of your food and making it look more magenta, InstaDoom is for you! Play Doom with any of the 40(!) official Instagram filters! Memento Mori with Mayfair! Requiem with Rise! Icarus with Inkwell! Alien Vendetta with Aden or Valencia!

ALSO INCLUDES: Selfie Doom: Buddy Adding Edition! Indulge your narcissistic urges even in the deepest corners of Hell! With the new multiplayer compatibility, take group selfies in front of famous landmarks! As seen in Le Monde!

Note that in any non-__ZDoom__-based port, the Selfie Stick replaces the BFG, and all chainsaw and BFG item placements are swapped, so you can pick up the Selfie Stick on Map01 ASAP. (Since the Doomguy doesn't have to worry about lugging around the BFG, he can also carry 50% more plasma ammo.) In _ZDoom_-based ports, the Selfie Stick is a special extra DECORATE weapon bound to the 7 key.

ALSO ALSO INCLUDES: InstaDoom DLC Pack 1! Is Instagram too "mainstream" for your tastes? Do you need filters -- er, I mean, "presets" -- that really scream, "I am a hipster"? Do you not care about usability? Then you'll love the new VSCO Cam DLC pack!

17 new filters (er, I mean, "presets") that emulate each of the currently-free filt- uh, presets in the VSCO Cam app! Most of them look like garbage, but they are painfully hip! Sneer at the basic bitches on Instagram with such purposely-obtusely-named presets as A4, B5, M3, and the ever-popular P5!!

*Base			: New from scratch
*Known Bugs		: Filters probably won't work properly with hardware-accelerated ports.
