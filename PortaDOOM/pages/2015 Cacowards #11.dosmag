:[9] `dead.wire` - <Xaser>
:===============================================================================

At the beginning of the year, <Tormentor667> played host to a competition called `Doomja-vu`, in which participants were made to create unique levels based on the layout of `E1M7: Computer Station`. The winner of this competition was <zrrion the insect> (a name more familiar to those over at the _ZDoom_ messaging boards) for his [M: Mouldy Old Void], an antique marvel that is rich in atmosphere and detail, and truly worth its weight in votes -- no question! Not being beholden to any contest or international law has its perks, though, and the _Cacowards_ team had already sent out its drones to survey the Doomscape and report back any hidden gems. What they found was this map for _ZDoom_, later posted on _Doomworld_ by its lonesome. The records will show that <Xaser> was on his lunch break at the time.

What is `dead.wire`? Is it any more dangerous than a live.wire? It's certainly more striking. <Xaser> appears to have taken more inspiration from `M7`'s name than he has from its layout, creating a world that is alien to most of what we're familiar with in concept, if not theme: a series of torch-lit chambers, monuments, and computer terminals that join together to create a floating complex in the void... and all of it dominated by static. That's the kicker, there: analogue television-grade fuzz. Poltergeist in `DOOM`. More than just a visual hook, this becomes a concept that dictates the gameplay from the get-go, with the monsters, layout, and setting all toying with the idea central to <Spielberg>'s smash-hit horror, that the veil between the real world and the other one is thin and ephemeral, tenuous at best. The resulting experience is a spooktacular tip-toeing, occasionally frenetic romp through unfamiliar traps and evils, including partially invisible monsters like the hell knight and lost soul. At first it might seem too dangerous an idea for a player base that is, by now at least, used to the idea of being able to effortlessly interact with what's in the front of them (with GUNS!), and I confess that I was frustrated at first. It was a cool setup that I was unable to enjoy fully because of the strain placed simply on seeing what it was I was shooting at. This a front-loaded issue that quickly unwinds as you stock up one some of the level's most gratifying countermeasures, including a super-powered laser gun and a flamethrower, and once you adapt a different approach to the problem, like rushing headlong into danger before the shadows in the corners of the map can shut your cowardly backside down.

<Xaser> is a modest soul and not known to flaunt his wares that much. At others' behest he will go to great lengths, donating his uniquely innovative approach to projects for which he expects -- and often gets -- little credit. Other than pointing out this fact wherever possible, the next best thing we can do is stand guard and prevent any of his greatest feats from flying off undetected. Hence this little wonder, plucked from the void.

^R- <Alfonzo>
