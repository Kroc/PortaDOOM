Even Doom had a beginning. After id Software completed Spear of Destiny and was ready to start on their next-generation game, it was time to start drawing up plans. Enter the Doom Bible. This design document, written by _Tom Hall_ in late 1992, was the original guideline for what would eventually become the shoot-em-up we all know and love. Doom was a different game back then: six episodes? Multiple characters? Cutscenes? While much of the material within the 16-section Doom Bible never found its was into the actual game, some items did; and their origins are now fully explained. Ever wonder why it's called the Soul Sphere? The Doom Bible had the answer. Did you know the word "gib" was around in 1992? Yup, it's there. If you've ever wondered what Doom's early stages were like, this is the document to read.

Following is the original Doom Bible in its entirety. Created by _Tom Hall_ in 1992, this document contains all the original ideas for Doom. As will be seen, Doom changed quite a bit from this original plan -- almost nothing found within these 16 sections made it to the full game. Nevertheless, it's an interesting read -- and explains more than a few mysteries about Doom's features.
