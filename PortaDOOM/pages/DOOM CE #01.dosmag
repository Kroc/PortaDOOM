:DOOM CE: PSX TC & D64 Retribution, overhauled!
:===============================================================================
*[T] .txt [W] Website
:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mod builds on the existing total conversions of `PlayStation DOOM` and `DOOM 64 for GZDoom`, `PSX DOOM TC` and `DOOM 64 Retribution`, to take advantage of the latest *GZDoom* versions and adds many features that make them more faithful but were impossible to implement at their time of release. To achieve this, a large amount of the code has been adapted from *GEC Master Edition* (also known as *DZDoom*), while looking at the reverse engineered code and existing source ports of these games for reference.

Press [â†’] (change page) to view details on each included game,
or select from below:

[1] *PSX DOOM CE + Lost Levels + No Rest For The Living
	:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The original `PlayStation DOOM`, expanded to include the missing PC levels + the XBOX addon campaign `No Rest For The Living`

[2] *PSX Final DOOM CE + Lost Levels + Master Levels
	:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The original `PlayStation Final DOOM`, expanded to include the missing PC levels and the complete `Master Levels`

[3] *DOOM 64 CE + Lost Levels + Bonus Campaigns
	:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The original `DOOM 64`, expanded to include the _Nightdive_ remaster levels (if present) + three extra community campaigns

:Feature Presets:
:===============================================================================
Since almost every feature is optional, the mod contains four presets for different levels of enabled "enhancements". They can be selected by going into the *Features Menu* and choosing *Features Preset*. It is recommended to choose one before you start a new game.

- *Faithful:* Features will be set as faithful as possible to the original

- *Faithful Enhanced:* Some enhancements such as smooth animations, ambient sounds, gore and particles trails will be enabled, but gameplay will remain faithful to the original

- *Modern (default):* More features including subtle gameplay changes will be enabled. Some monsters that weren't available in the console campaigns (Arch-Viles, etc) are also added

- *Experimental:* Same as Modern, but with new visuals and music style will change over time. In `PSX DOOM`, some monsters will have the same speed as in PC `DOOM`

:Highlights:
:===============================================================================
- `PSX DOOM` software lighting emulation (brightness fades with distance)
- `DOOM 64` with gradient and additive lighting. Can also be enabled in `PSX DOOM` too to give it a different look
- Addons to restore the `PSX DOOM` aspect ratio and to use the Nintendo 64's 3-Point filter
- The mod is powered by *ZScript* to make it more accurate to the original.
- `PSX DOOM TC Lost Levels` can be integrated into the regular episodes to provide the full PC level set
- Bonus episodes and maps for `DOOM 64` from the `Absolution TC` era
- Customizable speeds: approximate them to the slower framerate of the originals or make them faster for a bigger challenge
- Option to restore Arch-Viles in `PSX DOOM`, Spider Masterminds in `PSX FINAL DOOM`, `Absolution TC` exclusive monsters and `Doom 2` monsters (Revenants, Arch-Viles, etc) in `DOOM 64`
- The Red and Green Demon Keys exclusive to the `Outcast Levels TC` are included in that episode
- Choose to play with the dark ambient Console soundtrack, the action oriented PC soundtrack, or both, in which action fades into ambient after the music finishes
- AI interpolated `DOOM 64` animations and `Smooth Doom` adapted to `PSX DOOM`
- 2x AI upscaled textures.
- PBR materials.
- Brightmaps for sprites and textures.
- Play with a fullscreen hud styled like `DOOM 64` or the default *GZDoom* hud
- Ambient sounds for decorations (torches, barrels, etc)
- Enemies and the player produce footstep sounds
- Optional story texts taken from the manuals or readme files if they were fanmade
- Two new difficulties: Nightmare/Hardcore is UV with fast monsters and no respawns, and Ultra-Nightmare/Doomslayer is a modified version of the difficulty introduced in `DOOM 64: Retribution`
- Integrates `Nashgore` with slight tweaks and bug fixes
- Higher quality and more varied sound effects
- High quality soundtracks
