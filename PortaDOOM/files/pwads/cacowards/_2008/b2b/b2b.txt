Description             : After making a large map with slopes, scripts, all new resources
			  and whatnot, I felt like making something very basic.

			  Also used this opportunity to get some maps that were gathering
			  dust finished and released; a very old episode 2 project (although
			  I have released e2m1 of that project before as e2m1er.wad), and a
			  project for EDGE that got to 1½ levels (Rust). The maps were
		 	  converted to use vanilla resources only (except for the sky).

			  E2M5-E2M9 however are brand new levels for this release. The wad is
			  tested to be vanilla compatible, though during mapping it has mainly
			  been tested with ZDoom for convenience's sake. Also found to work with
			  Eternity. But as it is vanilla compatible, any port should work.

			  Updated 22.12.2007:

			  Fixed a trap door not working in doom.exe, the nodes were
			  built with zennode to fix most slime trails, and there's a couple 
			  of minor changes in level design.

Additional Credits to   : Lüt for (lots of) playtesting and bugging to finish it,
			  and CodeImp for the marvellous Doom Builder. And Esselfortium
			  for (not) playtesting it.
