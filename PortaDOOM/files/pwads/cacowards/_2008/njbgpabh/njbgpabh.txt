If I have missed any one out, I'm genuinely sorry. :(  
Please let me know if I should have included you.

I guarantee that there is something in these files that I have 
forgotten to credit.  Some of the resources have been sitting 
on my hard drive for years, over a decade in some cases, and
I simply can't remember where they all came from.
