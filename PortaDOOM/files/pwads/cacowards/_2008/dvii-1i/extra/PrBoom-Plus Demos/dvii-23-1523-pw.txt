Description:

Whee BFG slaughter! With the amount of ammo available you're only limited by
how aggressive you can play without getting yourself killed. Health is not as 
generously placed but there's still enough to let you get away with more than
a few unlucky hits.

You can expect to die very often on the way to the blue key room, but once you
get there and live through the onslaught 'till the gates open again the second
invulnerability should be enough to let you get to the cleric wing safely. I
take a small detour and clear the blue key wing of some of the monsters on the
way there. In the red key wing spamming rockets should be enough of a tactic but
be careful not to let the clerics advance too far before the gates open. Once
they do you can get an unlucky surprise in the form of all the YK cybers so
prepare the BFG in time. Once you get rid of the remaining monsters and open up
the central structure you'll have enough ammo to kill everything left in the map
twice, and health should no longer be a problem as well. Getting to the first
invulnerability can be tricky if the monsters spread out and block you. Afterwards
it's all about managing the invulnerability spheres and timing the archie spawns.

I think the map doesn't like me, in both this and the first exit demo I've missed
a revived chaingunner :P After all the failed attempts I didn't feel like redoing
it yet again though.
