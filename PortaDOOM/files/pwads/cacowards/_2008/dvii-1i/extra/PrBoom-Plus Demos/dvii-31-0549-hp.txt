Description:

My second UV-Max exit through The Manliest Fight Ever. The health and (for
the most part) ammunition that you've been given at the beginning of the
level is all you've got to beat the 490 inhabitants. In that sense,
provoking infighting and playing conservatively is key to winning. But
for a fast UV-Max, ignore the last sentence and dodge those fireballs.
I didn't have a particular plan for this run, but a few things I 
observed or improvised:

The cyberdemons needs to go, ASAP. My health is only going to go down as
time elapse, and the longer the cybers stick around, the more likely I'm 
going to have to confront them with a bleeding face (without cool looking 
shades).

When I'm on invuln, first priority is cyber, second revenant, probably
won't have time for another task.

The Cacos have no problem traversing between the gladiatorial arena and
the beachfront, if I fight in one spot for awhile, all of the provoked
cacos will fly to me. This neat little tactic saved me the trouble of 
confronting the cacos in the arena, as I could take the caco fight 
anywhere on the map.

You could probably improve it by a minute or two with more precise play.
