Description             : The UAC is once again, concocting more
                          groundbreaking experiments on teleportation. They
                          thought they were ready to handle everything that
                          came their way. While traveling between dimensions, 
                          something unexpected happened. 
                          An unknown enemy force appeared out of nowhere. 
                          An evil, much more sinister than
                          the last, single-handedly wiped out the first UAC
                          Marine squadron, and is gradually killing off the
                          remaining Marines. Everyone who has seen this
                          evil, has been annihilated. Except, for one. You.
                          You must take on this evil all alone. As you
                          watch the rest of you're comrades get
                          slaughtered by this unworldly evil, you must make
                          your way to the sinister mastermind behind all of
                          this destruction. Can you repel the evil before
                          you? Load up you're weapons.
