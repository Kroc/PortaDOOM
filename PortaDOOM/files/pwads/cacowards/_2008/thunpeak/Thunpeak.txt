Title                   : Thunderpeak
Filename                : Thunpeak.wad
Release date            : August 12th, 2008

Description             : These are my two maps "Thunderpeak powerplant" and "Termination"
from the recently released Zpack community project!
Since there seem to be quite some interest in it, I decided to release those two maps as a standalone project.
I will also release my "Blackrock" map seperately, but I plan to add 1 or 2 maps to it to make the replay more worthwhile!
