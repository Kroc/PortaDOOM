Description             : All maps are: 
                          (i) medieval-themed, and generally very large 
                            compared to typical DooM maps; 
                          (ii) non-linear and feature multiple paths; 
                          (iii) feature castle and fortress architecture, 
                            fights on an epic scale, and magnificent vistas. 
                          Maps 08-10 can be played in any order within the 
                            hub, and powerups & enemies are different in any
                            given map depending on whether you play it first
                            or play it after entering from another map. This 
                            provides additional replay value.
                          
                          This is a 7-map demo. TeamTNT intends to create
                          a full megawad next.
                          
                          Tested with ZDooM and GZDooM

IMPORTANT INFORMATION   : Maps 08-10 constitute a hub, and MUST be started 
                            from Map 08. 

                          To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDCLEV
                            cheat code to warp to any of the maps in the hub. 
                            (i.e. *DO NOT* begin the game by warping to Map 09
                            or 10). Doing so will mess up the scripts and will 
                            leave you stuck in the map to which you warp. [You 
                            can warp to a map just to look around if you wish]

                          To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDCLIP 
                            cheat code to leave the intro area or the hub area
                            in Map 08. Doing so will mess up the scripts and 
                            will leave you stuck in the map.

                          To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDKFA cheat 
                            code to get weapons in the hub. Doing so could mess 
                            up the scripts and will leave youstuck in the map 
                            in which you used the cheat code.  [This is 
                            particularly true of the chainsaw, as once you've 
                            gotten it through the cheat code you cannot pick it
                            up in the map. This could prevent you from being
                            able to leave the map.]

                          For co-operative play read the text file coop.txt 
                            before playing.
