For coop play

General instructions for levels 11, 12, 13

All levels are set up for coop play but have not been tested, but should play
pretty well.  I can see the use of elevators possibly causing some problems in
a few areas.  I have used a series of teleports to help speed up gameplay as 
these levels are very large and without these teleports coop play would be very 
tedious and boring.

(Level 11) Return to the Forlorn Fortress

At the start of this level you will see a fountain (pool of water). If you die
during the game you will want to jump into this pool of water and you will be 
teleported in to a small room which will become a long hallway as the game 
progresses. As the game progresses the hallway becomes longer and more teleports
open up on the right side of the hallway. Gather up all keys and weapons available
and always take the last available teleport as you move down the hallway. This 
should give you everything you have collected and get you pretty close back to 
the action. There will be some ammo available also but don't get greedy as you may 
need some more later.

(Level 12) House at Pooneil Corners

In this level you start in a narrow outdoor passage. At the first corner is a 
teleport which is not yet available (too high). Shortly in the game after going 
through the first locked door this teleport lowers. Once this teleport lowers 
always use it if you die. You will be teleported into a small room. There should 
always be only one teleport to use. Gather up all items and use it. If more than
one teleport is available use the most currently open one (as you move clockwise
around the room).

(Level 13) 2400 Fulton Street

You start in a dark cave-like room. At some point early in the game after leaving 
the first main area a wall lowers in the start area giving access to a small 
hallway. Gather up all items and take the last available teleport on your left.
