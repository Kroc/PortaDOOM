Misc. Author Info       : 

Description             : A total conversion set in the mid-50's on a weapons research base deep in the heart of
			Greenland. You thought this would be a nice boring way to finish your career as a Marine. 

			You thought wrong. (see cah_manual.pdf for the full story)

Important Notes         : There are a number of new keys added that need to be bound before playing.

			If the snow is slowing your computer, you can toggle it (default F12).

			If you have a computer that is borderline capable of running GZDoom, you can try loading
			cah_reducedFX.pk3 after cah_se.pk3 to run CaH without some of the more resource-hog
			effects (namely dynamic projectile lights and the new flamethrower effect).

			This mod is NOT intended to run in resolutions lower than 640 x 480.
