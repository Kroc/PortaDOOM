Welcome to Cold as Hell: Special Edition

If you played (or tried to play) the original Cold as Hell, you can
now re-play the whole thing without the various annoying bugs
that made the original release essentially impossible to play. 
If your're new to Cold as Hell, you're in for a treat.

All you need is a copy of GZDoom (1.1.06 or greater)
and the computer hardware to support its OpenGL mode, you can
experience features entirely new to CaH including enhanced
fire, smoke, 3d floors, dynamic lighting, and more!

------------------------------------------------------------
THE STORY SO FAR
------------------------------------------------------------
It is 1954, and you are Gunnery Sergeant Henry Mills, a battle-hardened
United States Marine. You fought in World War II, seeing heavy combat in 
the Pacific Theater and receiving numerous commendations for your bravery
and dedication to your fellow soldiers. You are an expert in small arms
and unarmed combat, and you have been tested time and again in battle.

After World War II, you were assigned to a combat infantry unit that
fought extensively in the Korean War. Again you distinguished yourself,
fighting with distinction in some of the heaviest conflicts in the war.

After the end of the Korean War, you were shipped back to the United States
for assignment to your final post before retirement. You were assigned to
a post in Greenland - head of security for the special projects division
at Research Station 46-A. You expect it will be a quiet, if uncomfortable,
assignment to finish out an exemplary career in the United States Marine Corps.


------------------------------------------------------------ 
INSTALLING COLD AS HELL 
------------------------------------------------------------
Make sure that you have all the files from cah_se.zip installed into
one directory. In addition to the files included, you will need:

-A copy of DOOM2.WAD

For the Special Edition, you will need a copy of:
-GZDoom 1.1.06 or higher (available at http://grafzahl.drdteam.org/)

It is recommended that you use the included batch files to run the mod. They
will automatically load everything you need and set up a new .ini file to
store the control configuration and display settings in, in case you
want to bind functions to keys that might conflict with your normal
Doom settings (for example, you might want to bind "view objectives" to the
TAB key, since CaH does not use the automap).


-------------------------------------------------------------
PLAYING COLD AS HELL
-------------------------------------------------------------
During the course of the game, you will receive periodic updates to your mission
objectives, which can be viewed at any time by holding down the key you
bind to "show objectives." These objectives will vary, but generally
speaking your goal is to survive and escape the situation you find yourself in.

Your objectives will display a location to the left of the objective so that
you have a general idea of where you need to go to accomplish that objective.


-------------------------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES IN COLD AS HELL 
-------------------------------------------------------------
You should familiarize yourself with both the mission objectives display and
the ability to view your log of found notes (see NOTES, ACCESS CODES, and TAPE DECKS).
In order to be successful in your mission, you will need to do more than simply
kill the enemy, you will also have to accomplish your goals.

Also, the weapons and health system in Cold as Hell do not behave the same as they
do in regular DOOM. You should check the sections on YOUR WEAPONS and YOUR HEALTH
to see what has been changed.

Throughout your mission, you may encounter friendly soldiers that will fight on your
side. These soldiers may make the difference between defeat and failure, so be sure
to help them out however you can.


-------------------------------------------------------------
ON-SCREEN INFORMATION 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cold as Hell uses a HUD that is dramatically different from that of the 
original DOOM:

Objective/Note Display (upper-left)
-This shows your current objectives or the text of the selected note. Your
objective display will stick around until you release the objective key, and your
note display will stay until you press the "read note" key again.

Pickup Messages (upper-left, below objective/note display)
-This will appear when you pick up a weapon, ammo, health, or other key item 
to let you know what you picked up. When a weapon is first picked up, this will
show some brief information about the new weapon)

Health Bar (lower-left)
-This shows your relative health.

Status Indicator (below health bar on the left)
-This shows your general condition

Bleeding Indicator (below health bar on the right)
-If this appears, it indicates that you are bleeding. The worse you bleed, the more
health you lose. You should bandage your wounds right away (see YOUR HEALTH for details)

Ammo Display (lower-right)
-This shows two numbers: the number on the left is the number of bullets/shells left in your
current weapon, and the number on the right shows the number of clips remaining.
(NOTE: Some weapons display this differently, see YOUR WEAPONS)

Bandage Timer (lower-right, replaces ammo display if bandages are selected)
-This will show how many seconds you must keep using a bandage to stop bleeding. 
See YOUR HEALTH for details.

Key Display (upper-right)
-This will show and keys you have collected as well as any support objectives you've completed.


-------------------------------------------------------------
CONTROLLING THE ACTION 
-------------------------------------------------------------
The basic controls are the same as regular DOOM, but be aware that you will move
slightly slower than the DOOM marine. ZDoom supports both jumping and crouching, both
of which will be very helpful in surviving your mission.


-------------------------------------------------------------
MOVING AROUND THE COMPLEX 
-------------------------------------------------------------
After a certain point, you may find yourself with a wide range of possible 
destinations within the 46-A complex. You are free to move back and forth between
areas at your leisure, although you may find that you need to complete certain objectives
to proceed. Levels will remain as you left them when you leave and come back, and
you will keep all of your weapons and items between levels.


-------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR WEAPONS
-------------------------------------------------------------
Cold as Hell adds a whole arsenal of new weapons that behave very differently
than those of DOOM. Your weapons are powerful, although they have limited
clip sizes and must be reloaded when they are out of ammunition.

1 = Fist
-A two-punch combo. Tapping the button gives you a solid one-shot punch,
while holding it down results in a rapid series of weaker punches.

2 = Colt M1911 Pistol (8 rounds in a magazine)
-A USMC classic, this pistol fires a powerful .45 caliber round. This is your
standard issue sidearm, and you will have it available at all times except when traveling
on friendly aircraft (for safety reasons!).

3 = Winchester M1897 Shotgun (8 shells in the chamber)
-A powerful weapon at close ranges. The shot spread prevents it from being effective at
long range, but it is devastating if used up close.
(NOTE: hold the reload button to keep reloading shells in rapid succession)

4 = Stevens Arms 311e Shotgun (2 shells at a time)
-A double-barreled shotgun that can fire both barrels very quickly, delivering a powerful
close-range blast. Because of its simple design, reloading this shotgun is very fast.

5 = Colt M1928A1 Submachine Gun (30 rounds in a magazine)
-The famous "Tommy Gun" is a powerful, accurate weapon that is highly effective against
soft targets. It fires the same powerful round as the M1911 and has a 30-round magazine.
Be careful though, the Tommy Gun is hard to control in rapid-fire and loses accuracy quickly.

6 = Browning M1918A2 Light Machine Gun (30 rounds in a magazine)
-The Browning Automatic Rifle has been equipped with an extended 30-round magazine and is
the primary support weapon of the US Army and Marine Corps. It fires a powerful .3006 cartridge
that can make short work of most targets. Fire in short bursts, because the BAR is very hard
to control in rapid fire.

Also, keep an eye out for BARs mounted to vehicles. If one is unoccupied, you can walk
up and press the "use" key to jump on. The mounted BARs have a 100-round box magazine and
an unlimited pool of reserve ammo, but they cannot be removed from their mounting points.

7 = Springfield Armory M1 Garand rifle (8 rounds in a clip)
-The M1 Garand is a veteran of numerous conflicts, firing a powerful and accurate .3006 round
from a durable semi-automatic rifle. The Garand provides you with the ability to accurately engage
enemies at longer ranges.


? = Remember that Station 46-A is a facility heavily involved in weapons research, so keep an eye
out for additional weapons. You've heard that they're working on an ultra-portable flamethrower
and some kind of rifle related to the M-14 project. Maybe you can find out more when you arrive.


Most weapons use a magazine or clip of some kind. If you reload before your weapon is dry, you
will waste whatever ammo was in the magazine you threw out, so be careful to balance between your
reserve mags and timing your reloads to avoid running dry in a fight.
(NOTE: Cold as Hell will prevent you from reloading if your weapon is full so you don't accidentally
waste precious magazines)


-------------------------------------------------------------
COMBAT STYLES
-------------------------------------------------------------
Before you select a difficulty, you will be asked to select a combat style from a list of four
possible styles. These influence the difficulty of certain aspects of the combat in Cold as Hell:

ACTION: The simplest style, in Action mode, your weapons will automatically reload when they run
out of ammo, and bleeding will be reduced in frequency. Also, if you hold still for a few seconds
when below 20% health, you will start to heal up to 20% health. Once you begin healing using this style,
you are free to move around.

TACTICAL: Designed to provide a slightly more "realistic" experience while still remaining accessible. This
style disables automatic reloading and slightly increases bleeding frequency. Automatic healing below 20% health
remains, but you cannot move around while you are healing or the automatic healing will stop.

REALISTIC: This style is the most difficult, disabling automatic reloading and automatic healing below 20%. Also, bleeding
frequency is dramatically higher than the other styles, and when running your weapon accuracy will be substantially
decreased.

Classic CAH: The Classic Cold as Hell style is designed to provide an experience similar to that of the original
release of Cold as Hell. While automatic reloading is enabled, automatic healing is not. Bleeding frequency is at the same
level as the "Realistic" style, and your health has a maximum value of only 50% (the same as the original release). Please
note that the game is not balanced for this style in its current state, so you may find using this style to be much
more difficult in some cases.


-------------------------------------------------------------
YOUR HEALTH
-------------------------------------------------------------
You are tough, but slightly more vulnerable than in standard DOOM. There is no armor in
Cold as Hell for you to pick up, and you can start to bleed if you're injured. However, there are a
few things that will help you survive your mission:

-Small health packs: These will heal 10% of your max health.
-Large health packs: These will heal 25% of your max health.
-Bandages: If you are bleeding, select the bandages using the key set to "use bandage."
Once you select the bandages, hold down the "fire" key until the timer on the bandage finishes counting down
(this will take about 3 seconds). Once the bandage is used, it will remove one bandage from your inventory and
stop any bleeding. [NOTE: Bleeding is disabled in the easiest difficulty setting]

If you are not bleeding and your health is below 20% of your max health, you can stop for a few seconds to
rest. When you rest, your health will begin to slowly climb back up to 20% of the maximum. Once you've
started to heal, you are free to move around again. [NOTE: Some combat styles disable this feature or
restrict it]


-------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES and TAPE DECKS 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Throughout the complex, you will find numerous small notes or memos scattered around. When you pick these
up, they will be stored for you to read at any time using your note browse and read keys. By reading
these notes, you can get a better idea of what your mission is and what happened before you arrived.

Also, sometimes you MUST read certain notes to continue on. In this case, your objective screen will let
you know what to do.

Also, you may find tape decks scattered throughout the complex. These portable dictation recorders are
often used by senior command and research staff to keep track of their work. If you walk up to and use
these recorders, you may learn more about the events that led up to your arrival.
