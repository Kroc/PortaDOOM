Description:		Community is Falling 3 is the third sequal to the 'Community Is Falling'
			series, which are jokewads based on the drama and comedy inside the
			Doom community. Lots of inside jokes are involved so those who are
			outside the community will probably not understand most of whats
			going on. Unlike the previous two jokewads, this one is a full fledged
			36 - level megawad/TC that abuses as much Zdoom features as possible.
			The design of this jokewad is not like that of Mock2, or DoTims, rather than
			targeting a more serious design approach, followed by a not-so serious storyline.

			First I would like to say that I hate the Zdoom source port and I am
			not going to be working with this port ever again.

Story:			Happy members of the Doom community anticipate the release of KDiZD.
			The team responsible for the project couldn't have been more popular.
			People now want to be like them, people want to be as awsome as them.
			They had it all until that one horrific day; The day KDiZD was leaked..

			Doomworld and Zdoom communities soon began pointing fingers at each
			other, blaming the leak and the community itself began to go up in flames.
			Seeking refuge in #ZDoom, the remaining members of Doomworld sought
			out the 'hacker'. The same hero who saved Doomworld from the Quake 3
			and Steam communities and restored the Doom community from complete
			destruction.

			Unlike the other two adventures, the community that the hacker will fight
			against, is the Doom community itself. This will be the most intense fight
			he will ever be involved in.. the hacker realized that this could possibly
			be the actual end of the Doom community. Grabbing his frying pan and
			his internet gear, the hacker logs on to Doomworld and begins his quest....


FAQ:			Below is some questions and answers involving CIF3.wad
===========================================================================

Q:			CIF3 is running slow! Help!
A:			Set CL_Maxdecals to 1 or 0. Running in windowed mode causes CIF3 to run a little slower as well.
			Also, if you're running Zdoom at a ridiculously high resolution like 1280x1024, change it to at least 800x600
			or 640x480. I mean seriously, why a high resolution? For Doom even? Another thing you can do is set
			'screenblocks' to 11 or whatever maximum value. This hides all the complexed hud icons, leaving just
			the numbers like health, ammo etc. If CIF3 is still running slow, then delete CIF3.wad from your hard drive
			immedietley.

Q:			Help! I can't get past the dialog events with the Zelda like fonts!
A:			CIF3 comes  with custom key bindings that you will need to configure before you even start playing CIF3.
			Go to your options/key configurations menu and see the new key bindings.

Q:			DOES CIF3 SUPPORT CROUCHING AND JUMPING?!
A:			Yes. Against my wishes..
 
Q:			Does CIF3 have secondary fire for its weapons?
A:			Not all of them, but yes. You will need to play around with them and see what happens.

Q:			I WANT TO USE THE OLD DOOM HUD WHAAAAA!!
A:			CIF3 doesn't use the old Doom Hud. So you must set 'screenblocks' to either 10 or 11.

Q:			Is there co-op?
A:			Originally yes, but as the scripting got complexed, supporting co-op became impossible. Thus no.

Q:			Can I steal your ACS code?
A:			I've been debating about including the ACS code from the very start. I even wanted to make the code difficult
			to decompile as well just for the hell of it. I gave in and decided to include everything needed to compile CIF3.
			So in a ways, feel free to use the code. Note that I do not support them so use the code at your own risk.
			However I do appriciate that you take the time to at least credit me if any of the ACS code is used. All the
			ACS stuff should be in the /src folder.

Q:			You're using resources from other games! This wad is illegal!!
A:			Be my guest to report me. Despite that this is a non-profit wad based on a dramatic gaming community.

Q:			CIF3 randomly crashes Zdoom!
A:			You got me there. I don't know. Feel free to blame Zdoom and how much it sucks.
