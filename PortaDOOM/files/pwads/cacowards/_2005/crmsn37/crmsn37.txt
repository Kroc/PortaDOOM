Description             : A themed map series intended for single player exploration and 			  conquest.  Designed to be visually exciting, different and 			  	  fun, as well as provide intense combat situations with as 			  	  many enemies as could be packed in and survived.  This set is NOT 			  at all meant to kill the player in 60 seconds.    

Additional Credits to   : Catsy, for testing and much gameplay advice.

			  Ray Schmitz, Huy Pham, and Kaiser, for inspiration from their 			  ideas and designs.

			  Chilvence, Ichor, AlexMax, and Andrew McKie for showing 			  	  me how to make my own textures and get them into the wad.

			  Ultimate Doomer, Deathbringer, and Deepteam for explaining how to 			  get the animated ones working.

			  Doom_Dude, Doomed Ace, and Deepteam for giving me the info needed 			  to get the TITLEPIC and other game graphics working.

			  Geraldo Ramos Falci Jr. for additions to the Story.

			  Many others at NewDoom and DoomWorld forums, (too numerous to 			  remember all,) for their patience, wisdom, and valuable help.

Several of these are renamed, and most have been modified, and/or recolored from the originals.  All other added textures and flats are based upon original Id games resources, or made from scratch.  These are free to use however you wish, as far as I know or care.

INTERPIC is from Dantes Inferno by Gustav Dore

* Other Notes *
			  (1)  Map03 is based upon a map I made for the DoomWorld 			  	  Community Chest Part Deux.  

			  (2)  Maps 11 and 12 were intended to be a part of the 			  	  Congestion 1024 Project.

			  (3)  The highly confined spaces, lighting and texture schemes of 			  Map12 are based upon a concept developed by Azriel.
