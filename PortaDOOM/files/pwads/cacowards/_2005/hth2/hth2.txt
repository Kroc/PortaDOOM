Update to               : hth2.wad

Notice                  : A delayed fix. Hopefully got rid of Map05 startup 
                          crash problem. Texture checks, minor script 
                          adjustments etc. Map06 has few detail changes to 
                          avoid texture alignment issues etc. Maps04-06 
                          have some fake doors added to the storages (there 
                          was only air vents as passages, which looked odd). 
                          Map07 no longer go berzerk with GZDoom.

Advanced engine needed  : Legacy 1.40 (or higher), (or GZdoom too)
Primary purpose         : Single

Description             : What caused the hellspawn havoc in a remote 
                          science base? Could it have been a strange 
                          shipment sent from UAC teleport research 
                          center, a place called as 'Alien Tech'? 
                          It's time to find it out.

                          hth2 is a sequel for an (yet) unreleased
                          ZDoom wad. Featuring a storyline, dummy 
                          actors, intro/conversations you can skip, 
                          the very different kind of teleports you've 
                          ever seen before... and more.

===========================================================================
IMPORTANT:

- to avoid memory troubles, run legacy with -mb XXX option, 
  32 or more should be enough, for example:

legacy.exe -iwad ..\doom2\doom2.wad -file hth2.wad -mb 64

- SAVE GAMES working can't be quaranteed. There's a risk for 
  "corrupted save game errors", can't help with them - sorry.

GZDoom users:

GZDoom should work nice (tried with 1.0.03). With this fix, cutscenes 
should play nice and scripts no longer go bazooka with MAP07 (this was 
a bug in the scripts), etc. However:

- Some 3D objects' texture alignments might go bit wrong.

- 3D bridges with nukage rivers (MAP05 and MAP06) seem not to carry 
  the painful effect in some versions of GZDoom?

- If you wish to use GZDoom lights, run gzlights.wad with hth2:

gzdoom.exe -iwad ..\doom2\doom2.wad -file gzlights.wad hth2.wad

  (It's just the old doomdefs lump with a few changes) Most of the lights 
  should work OK, but a couple of light tricks could not be replicated. 
  (Maybe I'll try an update with this in the future.)

- Probably a trouble with older machines, if you see 3D objects' 
  side textures being horizontally distorted, try console command 
  "GL_RENDER_SEGS 0". (the default value = 1) Wonder if this occures 
  or helps with every machine. (or if it creates new troubles)

IMPORTANT NOTES:


SKIP'ABLE INTROS

- There are some scripted intros (featuring camera action, 
conversations, etc.) If you feel you don't want to seem them, but 
just want to skip'em (and rumble back into action), you can *DO IT*! 

When such an skip'able intro starts, in the left up corner (console) 
will shortly appear three white dots "* * *" - after that, at any time 
during the intro just hit "use" (= the key/button you use to open doors, 
hit switches, etc. ("space", mouse btn2 or 3 by default))

You'll hear a beep. The intro might not stop right away (some 
camera actions must be completed first) but in few seconds.

NOTE: you can skip them, but they also reveal things about the 
storyline, becoming events, objectives etc. (making them was not easy, 
please, look at them atleast once) MAP01 is just one huge intro, 
if you choose to skip it, you'll beam into intermission screen and 
continue to MAP02.

NOTE2: you can't skip all of them. Some camera actions take only 
couple of seconds and you'll just have to live with them.


GAMEPLAY

- jumping is required. looking down/up can be useful. 
  NOTE: you can jump over (almost) every railing in this level set.

- all levels should be dooalble even from a pistol start.


GAMEPLAY TIPS/HINTS

- there're plenty of hidden bonuses, weapons & ammo around - some are 
  hidden in a way only legacy can do!! (3D)

- MAP02: if you feel "short handed" in the beginning (zero ammo) 
  there're two shotguns in the entry teleport room walls. Use your 
  fists to get them!

- MAP06: if there's a vacuum inside the long-range teleport chamber, 
  try shooting pipes. Pipes with holes usually leak air...

- MAP04: (after the first section in the air vents) if there's poison 
  gas in the air vents it's not recommended to go in there (there's 
  a way to vent the gas out). However, if you manage to find your way 
  through the toxic vents, it's OK - the scripts will adapt that and 
  work a bit differently through the level.


"BUGS/TROUBLES"

- there's a risk for "corrupted save game errors" WATCH OUT!

- MAP03 starts with the player automaticly getting teleported 
  into a pool of legacy 3D water. For some reason I had Legacy having 
  some troubles with this, a few times:

1.41b - got error messages into console (they can be ignored)
1.42 - crashed

  If crashing happens to you, before teleportation (when the screen is 
  black) three white dots "* * *" will appear in the left up corner. 
  After that you have 2-3 seconds to hit "use", and you'll not 
  get teleported into the pool, but next to it.


- Scripts might not be "full-proof", (there's total 125 kb of scripts)
  play nice and everything should work nicely.

- the intros are using dummy actors having conversations etc. The green 
  player IS REPRESENTING YOU (= our marine hero)! If you have chosen 
  a different color, or are using a skin, you'll be wondering why 
  in some camera actions you're having your usual outlook while in 
  some you're a green marine... (that is: do not use skins or your 
  own colors!)

- MAP02 - 07 are all having "GRAVITY 0.75" commands in their script 
  files, but for some reason legacy seems occasionally ignoring this 
  command. (you'll get gravity 1.00 instead) Just nevermind, you should 
  get everywhere with that too (minus couple of bonuses though).

- if you have no gl support, you'll get a few console error messages 
  about coronas. Just ignore them, all important scripts will still work!

- legacy could have troubles with translucent walls (= solid windows)
  Normal textures used in 2s walls could be invisible behind the 
  window (there's few places where this might occure) Windows also 
  tend to flash (less translucent vs. more translucent) at some viewing 
  angles.

- (with some systems) ambient sounds could have troubles, they fade 
  when you turn and come again when you turn some more. And (with some 
  systems) coronas might not look too good either?

- in general: there are plenty of stuff I don't know should it be 
  done like this (such as using boom generalized specials numbers in 
  fs scripts) but everything seems to work nice with _my_ system...


OTHER COMMENTS:

- English is not my native language, so the intros/texts in the game 
  probably have grammatical errors and expressions that'll sound 
  "odd" (sorry)

- These levels are not pitch dark! You can see in there! (sorry)
  but instead of that the detail level is a bit more higher...

- All the flats, textures, patches, graphics and sprites (minus one) 
  were made for *this* wad. (some base to original Doom textures)
  Almost all textures are compiled from gazillion itchy-bitchy 
  sized tiny patches. It saved some megs of space and building 
  this wad was a hobby (= pure fun ;)

  If you want to use flats or patches in this wad - go a head!


PLAYTESTING

- These levels were developed with a "rusty" AMD Athlon 1000, 128Mb 
  with a NVidia's postcard - and it works great... (uh, couch)
  I guess any five years younger machine should do fine.

- "Playtested" (walked through) with Legacy versions:

1.40(dos) - should work fine
1.40, 1.41b, 1.42(win32) - should work fine
1.32beta32(win32) - does not work

  Most of the developement was done with 1.40(win32).
