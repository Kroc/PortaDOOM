Misc. Author Info       : I make maps.

Description             : "The last thing you remember is trying to leave this god-forsaken temple of evil and chaos, 
			only to find yourself being blown to bits by several large, hulking CyberDemons toting 
			Rocket Launchers. So, how is it that you ended up here? You are in what appears to be the 
			UAC base on Phobos, but, why? Something is wrong, however. The base has been overrun by 
			hellspawn and you keep having strange visions of demonic evil flashing before your eyes. 
			This cannot possibly be the base, but rather.. a warped reality of some kind."

			Here comes the highly-unwanted sequal to one of the worst maps of the decade! 
			Temple of Chaos 2 is the lousy sequal to the lousy, you guessed it, Temple of Chaos! 
			Things you can expect to see in this map are as follows: Dull, Doom 2 Map07 style gameplay 
			(having to kill monsters in order to beat the map), Random, overdetailed rooms, etc.

			Sounds good? It doesn't? I thought so. Okay then.

			The main reason I started working on this map is to test out some random idea that 
			had popped into my head. I think it works quite well. I may possibly use this idea for a more 
			serious map in the future (GEO - Part 2 anyone?) (not gonna happen)
