Description             : An updated version of altar666, changed several things to make gamplay run smoother(hopefully)
                          Made this level suited for skill levels, since the original had only one (call me lazy for that)

                         -Skill 1/2 relatively easy gameplay mostly weaker monsters like imps, no decorate monsters here.
                          It should be easy to beat for most players, plenty of ammo and health and a total of 407 monsters.

                         -Skill 3 pretty hard stronger monsters will be on this level, no decorate monsters in large numbers.
                          Also NO Ashwraiths on this level only a few Flamedemons and Nightmare spectre's and thats it.
                          Plenty ammo and health availible, can be beaten by somewhat more skilled players 533 monsters.

                         -Skill 4 insane gameplay this is hell very hard if not impossible to beat 600 monsters.
                          Be ready to fight hordes of stronger decorate monsters at once, even more ammo and health avialible.
                          You need fast reflexes to get past my Ashwraiths, jus keep your distance to them and fire away.
                          If you don't like decorate monsters and are not that skilled in playing doom, don't play on UV.

                         -Skill 5 nightmare mode...ARE YOU CRAZY!!!!
