Description             : This is the sequel to my old megawad "Scythe". Expect better
			  looking and bigger levels. unfortunately, the last 3 levels are 
			  missing, because I am so lazy and I haven't been satisfied with 
			  my attempts at making map28. I _might_ release the last 3 maps
			  some time in the future, but do not count on it. 
			  (Update: the last 3 maps are now completed!)
,
Additional Credits to   : id software, testers Qwerty, Vile, Vincent, Khaoscythe, Anima Zero and others.
			  The gothic crew for textures (see below), Kristian Aro for
			  compiling the Ruinbros resources. Randy Heit for zdoom,
			  Colin Phipps and TeamTNT for prboom/boom. CodeImp for Doombuilder.
			  Kristian "Ebola" Käll for the name "Scythe" (forgot you in scythe.txt, sorry)
			  Anders "schepe" Åstrand for encouragement.
			  Fredrik Johansson for some additional textures (and for making incredible levels).
			  Wad Guru Kim "Mutator" Malde for level name graphics.
			  Julian for intermission and titlepics.
			  Espi for monster sprites. Lutrov71 for the BOSSBACK entry.
			  
			  Special thanks to Drew "stx-Vile" Devore for music selection,
			  suggestions and bugreports, this wad would not maintain
			  this kind of quality without his work.

Other                   :  

			   
* Play Information *
Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : Map01-32
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes 
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : No

Difficulty Settings     : Yes

This wad is harder than the original Scythe. I suggest
skill 2/3 for those that enjoyed Scythe on skill 4. I am not saying that skill 4 is murder though,
you just might need some savegames and careful play at times. Nightmare skill is as usual complete
madness except for the pros. Shortly after map20, you WILL run into trouble on skill 4.
 
* Construction *
Base                    : New levels from scratch
Build Time              : No idea, way way too long anyway. I started this in late 2003.
Editor(s) used          : Deth, Doombuilder (thank you Gherkin/CodeImp), Warm, Deutex, Zennnode, Wintex, XWE

Known Bugs              : Texture alignment bugs. Probably other bugs too.		 
			    
May Not Run With...     : Doom2.exe. Don't even try it. The new version is however compatible with pure limit removing ports.

Lame story (tm):
You travel through dimensions and kill monsters, blah blah... Use your imagination. 

Here are the maps, presented in order:

EPISODE I
MAP01 - CASTLE ENTRYWAY  	- quick start, mostly easy, especially after the CG.
MAP02 - ROOFTOP WARZONE 	- challenging moments, mostly easy though.
MAP03 - CASTLE GARDENS II  	- bigger fights already, watch out for the open area revenants.
MAP04 - CURSED CELLARS  	- easier again, this map is kinda similar to the original scythe maps.
MAP05 - HALLS OF ANGUISH 	- stolen inspiration from gothic2, I hope it didn't turn out too ripoff-ish.
				  (gothic2 map26), of course I can't match Malcolm's sense for details
				  and perfection, plus I made this in less than 2 hours (from scratch of course).

EPISODE II
MAP06 - TEMPLE ENTRYWAY	    	- berserk action, find the secrets! not a trivial map.
MAP07 - TEMPLE OF ISIS   	- map07 all over I suppose. A lot of space here mostly.
MAP08 - GRAVEROBBERS		- The first "long trek" map. A good challenge and some eye candy.
MAP09 - VALLEY OF THE QUEEN	- The worst map of the bunch no doubt, fun for RL nuts maybe. Dunno what I was thinking.
MAP10 - PHARAOS TOMB		- this map makes up for the shortcomings of map09, not easy!

EPISODE III
MAP11 - UAC BASE X		- here we go, back to basics. A bit boring perhaps, but hey it's a base.
MAP12 - BATTLEGROUNDS		- A good map, not too hard when handled properly.
MAP13 - MINING PROJECT		- kinda strange map, varied action and empty space. Not a great map.
MAP14 - THE HAUNTED MINES	- the first hard map, revenants and prettiness everywhere.
MAP15 - END OF THE LINE		- the same style as the previous map, detail and action.

EPISODE IV
MAP16 - MR X			- ...
MAP17 - CANYON OF BLOOD		- watch out for low fps, the most complicated (and crappiest) 3d bridge ever?
MAP18 - LIVING LANDS		- finally a good map! balanced action and a certain amount of feel.
MAP19 - WITHERING AWAY		- just a solid scythe II map, nothing for you sp_hot haters (yeah you Ebola).
MAP20 - THE GATES		- time for some eye candy, but you better keep your eyes peeled for distant rockets.
 				  Credits to my girlfriend for the basic idea of this one.

EPISODE V
MAP21 - DOOM GARDENS		- Low ammo, medium detail. The theme is a bit unusual and pretty nice imo.
MAP22 - THE GARDEN BASE II	- Cramped start, you will need the berserk on skill 4. Not an easy map.
MAP23 - WHISPERING WINDS	- The first insanely hard map, the start and some of the fights later on are very very hard.
MAP24 - GAIAS TEMPLE		- Maybe a little bit easier than map23, but there are nasty traps everywhere. High detail.
MAP25 - FORGOTTEN CITY		- A rather grand outdoor map. Not much of a city. Very hard.

EPISODE VI
MAP26 - DEATH			- Low ammo, very hard start. Very hard and cramped map in general.
MAP27 - AFTERLIFE II		- Huge castle/hell map. Extremely difficult and rather low ammo.

The end... NOT!

MAP28 - NIGHTMARE		- Slaughter map deluxe with a pretty high pace possible for the strong players out there. Quite hard.
MAP29 - DUST TO DUST		- Much lower paced map. It doesn't really look like anything I usually create... Not insanely hard.
MAP30 - HAUNTING DREAMS		- Thank you and goodbye! Very very hard.
