Descrption:             Your car broke down for no apparent reason so you decide to walk to the nearest town. 
			On your way there you notice an odd occasional balloon here and there elevated slightly
			above the treeline running along both sides of the road. 
				"Balloons? What the fuck. This better not be some lame joke wad," you say to 
			yourself, not even knowing what that means. 
			You finally arrive at what seems to be the start of a town. The sky is full of thick 
			layers of unusual clouds. You start to turn and head back but after a few steps you run 
			into some kind of invisible barrier that wasn't there a second ago. 
				"I'm going to kill the author of this lame-ass wad." you mutter to yourself, again
			not knowing what you just meant by that. You realize that the only way out is through 
			the town. Luckily you brought along your pistol, something you grabbed just as you left your
			car.
