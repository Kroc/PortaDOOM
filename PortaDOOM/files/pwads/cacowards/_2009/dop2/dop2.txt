Description             : An obvious sequel to Demons of Problematique. No
                          cutscenes (aside from the ending), no new
                          weapons, no new monsters, just Doom. With some
                          fancy effects.

                          Be sure to turn up the music volume to above the
                          SFX volume. Music is used sparingly but serves a
                          purpose other than just background noise. There
                          are plenty of ambient sounds to provide
                          atmosphere during regular play.

                          If you are masochistic enough to want to subject
                          yourself to the Nightmare! difficulty level, you
                          can do so by entering the Hard level teleporter
                          from the backside.

                          Requires GZDoom using it's OpenGL renderer,
                          using the software renderer will not work.
                          Looks best with dynamic lights enabled and set to
                          their default size, all shader options turned on
                          and fog enabled. It was designed specifically for
                          these settings, so the appearance of levels will
                          not be the same if some of these settings are
                          disabled or modified from their default values.

                          Revision 1: 20th september 2009
                          Revision 2: 11th november 2009

                          Changes in revision 2:
                           - Fixed lightmode setting missing for MAP05,
                             causing the Icon of Sin silhouette to be
                             absent, and generally make things brighter.
                           - Reduced GLLight sizes slightly so that they
                             look better with GZDoom's default light size
                             setting of 1.0.
                           - Reduced difficulty for the MAP05 boss fight
                             slightly, by lengthening some battle delays.
                           - A bunch of miscellaneous tweaks throughout.
                           - Added links to original song sources.
