Tribute.wad author notes.

I decided to make this in FAQ format because I prefer reading FAQs to anything
other form of 'help'.

Q: Are these questions made up?
A: Yes.

===========================================
== GENERAL
===========================================
Q: This .wad file is huge!
A: It's irrelevant. Your resistance is futile. 

Q: I've played the first level when Tribute's demo was released.
   Did the first map change in any way?
A: I changed the weapon placement and the beginning cutscene. If you don't
   want to play the first map again feel free to skip to MAP02. All maps
   are beatable from pistol start but if you want to have the weapons
   you should have from MAP01 use 'give' console command to get:
   combatshotgun, supershotgun, chaingun, rocketlauncher.
   Example: give supershotgun

Q: Why do you claim that there are 4 levels? I see 8 maps.
A: Some maps are parts of previous levels and are set up for boss fights.
   This is done for survival players so the whole huge level won't restart
   when they're suprised by the boss.
   
Q: How do difficulty levels influent the maps?
A: Except from standard "less monsters - additional powerup" thing the bosses
   have significantly less hit points on lower difficulty levels. Some parts
   can still be challenging for inexperienced players even on easy.
   
Q: What are the recommended DMFlags and other settings?
A: First of all you don't need jump. It's fine if it's on, it's fine if it's 
   off. Second - doubleammo 1 will cause combatshotgun glitch (described
   below).
   Also you should turn cooperative weapons on. It's done by 
   "sv_noweaponspawn 0" command. It's the same thing that makes BFG appear on 
   Doom2 MAP01.
   And finally if you're playing in OpenGL Depth Fog should be on for full
   atmospheric effect.
   
Q: Your English is funny.
A: No to co?

Q: Combat shotgun is loading two shells into the chamber while using only one
   from the inventory. Why?
A: Turn off double ammo (unless you really need it on). There should be enough
   ammo for 3 players coop. This also occurs on "I'm too young to die" 
   difficulty level. It's how doom works and I couldn't come up with any
   workaround.
   
Q: What are the multiplayer problems?
A: Most of them are cosmetic issues - like cameras changing 3 seconds after
   the level starts instead of immediately. Some delays had to be placed
   to overcome SkullTag (97d3-RC2) bugs.
   Anyway there are no serious problems that would break the level down and make
   it unbeatable.
   
Q: I was playing on multiplayer and I died and now my way is blocked by metal
   bars (for example boss fight on MAP05). Am i stuck?
A: Search for a nearby teleporter. If one way closes another one opens.

Q: What is the recommended player limit?
A: Maps were made to support 4 players without telefrags. It's not possible to 
   telefrag a player by walking into teleporter right after him. However if 
   there are more than 4 players you can get telefrags during some cutscenes and
   this might lead to some unwanted situations (read: more cosmetic issues :P)
