Misc. Author Info       : The team came together specifically to work on
                          Plutonia 2. Previously the project was in the
                          hands of other authors, which gradually dropped
                          out, led by Sam Woodman (aka Metabolist).

Description             : An add-on sequel for Final DOOM's "The Plutonia
                          Experiment". It emulates Plutonia's design and
                          gameplay styles and follows from where it left
                          off.

Additional Credits to   : The authors of The Plutonia Experiment, Dario and
                          Milo Casali.
