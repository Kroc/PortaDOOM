Description             : 7 levels for 'advanced' Boom compatible ports.

                          You need to have a BOOM compatible OpenGL port
                          with support of hi-res textures in wads, 
                          tall patches and music in the OGG format.

                          Currently there are only two ports which can handle
                          this wad correctly:
                          a) GLBoom-Plus 2.5.0.5 or higher;
                          b) GZDoom 1.3.13 Beta or higher;

                          Command lines:

                          glboom-plus -iwad doom2.wad -file hg.wad -complevel 9

                          gzdoom -iwad doom2.wad -file hg.wad

                          Textures: American McGee's Alice, Deus Vult, Half-Life;
                          INTERPIC graphics: O.Fronk;
                          Sounds: Half-Life, Power Slave, Eternal III;
