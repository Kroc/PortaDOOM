Misc. Author Info       : Amateur map designer and programmer of fine
                          softwares that nobody uses.

Description             : Started in 2009-ish, Coffee Break was intended to
                          be another 32 map megawad. Unfortunately, due to
                          a busy schedule, laziness, and other excuses, I
                          didn't finish it. But I do have 11 maps, so
                          there's that.
                          
                          Submitted for your approval are 11 short maps
                          designed to challenge all sorts of Doomers.
						  All were made with lots of tender love and care,
						  and with pistol starts in mind.

Additional Credits to   : Memfis, Harmata, Phml, Phobus, and the rest of
                          the Doomworld forums for feedback!

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Three years off and on. Did lots of other stuff
                          in between.
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder 2, SLADE, Bitmap Font Writer,
                          Paint.Net, Black Rook Doom Struct Library
Known Bugs              : Probably a misaligned texture or two that I
                          haven't found. 
May Not Run With...     : Non-Boom-compatible ports that don't support
                          "voodoo dolls" or extra skies, versions of Doom
						  that can't read MIDI music lumps (don't think
						  that's possible though, embedded MIDI support is
						  BOOM standard).
Other                   : If you play using ZDoom, the game will end after
                          MAP11. Nothing is replaced past that point.
