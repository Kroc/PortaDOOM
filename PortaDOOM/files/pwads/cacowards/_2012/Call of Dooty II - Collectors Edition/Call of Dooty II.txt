Description             : Let's face it:  Shooters today suck.  Their levels are too
			  linear, they aren't challenging enough, and they play more
			  like interactive movies than the experiences we once loved
			  up until the mid-2000s.  Call of Dooty II is an ode to the
			  terrible shooters that now inhabit the market and have taken
			  over the gaming industry by storm.  This WAD isn't supposed
			  to be fun to play - it's here to make a statement.

Additional Credits to   : John Romero - Original level design
			  kmoosmann - "If Quake was done today" video and inspiration
			  Knee Deep in ZDoom Team - Floating arrow indicators
			  Hans Zimmer - Soundtrack
                          Aubrey Hodges - Soundtrack
