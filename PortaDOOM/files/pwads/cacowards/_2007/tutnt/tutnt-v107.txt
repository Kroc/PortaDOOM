Description             : The Ultimate Torment & Torture is a compilation of all 
			  classic episodes totally remastered and revamped for 
			  more gameplay fun and visual candy as well as the all 
 			  new Episode 4 "Havoc" plus many new goodies and extra 
			  stuff. Fight yourself through each episode seperately 
			  or battle your way from the beginning through the whole 
			  game until you reach "The Source" for the final Showdown!

Technical Info		: Some of the maps, especially those with weather effects and
			  the later ones in Episode 4 are huge (kinda KDiZD), filled
			  with objects, sectors and lines. If you encounter framerate
			  drops, you can deactivate the weather effects with "W" (or
			  just define your own key in the menue). If this doesn't help,
			  your machine is too old or too slow to handle UTNT and you
			  can't do anything about it. Play the classics or buy a new
			  computer / new components :P
			  Beyond, "Fury of Fire" is independent from all the other
                          episodes and isn't included in the full play from the
			  beginning of Episode 1 to the end of Episode 4. Play it
			  seperate.	
			
Info on v1.05		: The latest version of UTNT is fully operationable in
			  Skulltag and is technically enhanced to ensure that you
			  won't encounter lags or slowdowns due too many packets
			  being sent and particles floating around. I changed all the
			  visual special effects to be clientside only and without
			  any interaction that could drop the network speed or
			  framerate. Special thanks to Torr Samaho for making this
			  flags reality and to Ghastly Dragon for fixing and improving
			  the whole decorate code for monsters and special effects, you're
			  awesome and those kind of nice guys that keep the community
			  alive and flowing :)

GZDoom Settings		: Shaders MUST be DEactivated
			   otherwise you will get visual glitches because shaders and
			   dynamic lights don't do good together.
			  Lightning Mode MUST be "Standard" style
			   to make sure that contrast and sector lights look exactly
			   the way they were intended to!

Resolution Info		: Make sure to play this in 4:3 resolutions instead of 16:9
			  to avoid graphical errors. Most of the gfx's in UTNT are
			  optimized for such aspect ratios.
				
Credits & Special Thx   : Type "changemap endmap01" in the console for a full list of
			  contributers. Thx to all of them and sorry to those who
			  I accidentally forgot. There were so many people who helped
			  me with and contributed to this that I might have missed one
			  or another.
