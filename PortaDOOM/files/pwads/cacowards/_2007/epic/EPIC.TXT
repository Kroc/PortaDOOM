Description             : One level for any boom compatible and
                          limit removing ports.
                          PrBoom-Plus or GZDoom are recommended.
                          To play this PWAD file, unzip it into the 
                          directory with your PWADs then start:
                          glboom-plus.exe -file epic.wad -complevel 9
                          (g)zdoom.exe -file epic.wad

                          Important:

                          Do not play map05 in the current prboom
                          (up to 2.4.8 for now), because of:
                          
                          a) All existing versions of prboom are buggy on
                          levels with big open areas - precision problems.
                          The latest Eternity release (3.33.33) also can't
                          handle map05 correctly - the same precision
                          problems. Use the latest SVN alphas.

                          b) The current glboom-plus (2.4.8.2.beta) is much
                          faster on levels with sectors which have too many
                          lines. I got 80 fps in glboom-plus instead of 50
                          in glboom at map05.

                          c) Vanilla GLBoom doesn't have an option for
                          quality rendering and it is very noticeable on
                          some levels, especially on the big tower at map05
                          and in the second room at map03 - big white
                          strips and dots on corners. The effect doubles
                          on ATI cards. Light sky is a headache of
                          prboom. So gl_render_precise should be 1.
                          I hope this variable will be removed in the
                          future versions and quality mode will be forced.

                          Note: gl_depthbuffer_bits in glboom-plus.cfg
                          should be 24 or 32 to avoid some rare small
                          glitches.
