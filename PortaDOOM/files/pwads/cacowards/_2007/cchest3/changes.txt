-------------------------------
Changelog for Community Chest 3
Second Release
-------------------------------

General:
- DEMO3 has been replaced with a better-looking demo.

MAP05:
- Removed a Pusher and Puller from a control sector that were both useless
because there was no actual pinpoint wind/current effect (266) applied to
the sector they were in, plus the conveyor belt already transfers the
needed items properly.
- Fixed a texturing error in the wooden part in the northwest section of
the map.
- Fixed a rendering error on the staircase that lowers in the center of the
map when the invulnerability sphere in the throne room is obtained.
- Fixed Hall of Mirrors effects in the alcove that lowers in the starting
area when the invulnerability sphere in the throne room is obtained.
- Fixed monster teleporters with same-line-teleport lines that were
erroneously flagged as one-time-use instead of repeatable.

MAP06:
- Fixed a set of sky sectors that didn't have sky transfers applied to
them.

MAP10:
- It is now much less likely, if not impossible, for you to shut the
closing door after the red switch without having gone all the way through
it.  If it does happen, however, the door can be opened (and could be
opened before) through a secret switch.
- The tripwire-activated door that you must open to reach the red door is
now more clearly marked.

MAP12:
- Certain items changed at author's request.
- Nazis and Commander Keens restored at author's request.
