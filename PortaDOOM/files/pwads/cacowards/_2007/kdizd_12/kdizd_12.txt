Description             : The experience of playing through Knee-Deep in
                          the Dead is one that many gamers will never
                          forget, but through the years the episode has
                          become too easy for many to play through and
                          enjoy the way they did the first time.

                          Knee-Deep in ZDoom is an interpretation of Id
                          Software's original groundbreaking production,
                          Knee-Deep in the Dead. The team has focused on
                          expanding the original episode by utilizing the
                          power of Randy Heit's ZDoom port; adding new
                          areas, features, and gameplay devices not
                          possible under the original Doom engine.
                          Knee-Deep in ZDoom is a new experience, but holds
                          strong to the atmosphere of the original. Relive
                          the fear. Relive the nightmare. Relive Phobos.

* Construction *

Base                    : Modified
Build Time              : 2 years, 9 months
Known Bugs              : None
Known Issues            : The code which draws translucent flats in ZDoom
                          gets the brightness information from the wrong
                          sector in some cases. This causes some minor
                          visual glitches, but does not affect gameplay.

GZDoom Issues           : GZDoom does not handle sprites in the same
                          way as ZDoom, and as such some visual effects may
                          not look correct. In order to minimize this, it
                          is recommended to set up GZDoom as follows:
                          In the GL display options settings, 'Adjust
                          Sprite clipping' should be set to 'smart'.

Changes for 1.1         : Many fixes to the maps
                          The item rotations are no longer part of the 
                          main file. Instead they are a separate package
                          If you want to use them you have to load
                          enable_item_rotations.pk3 with kdizd_11.pk3.						  
						  
Changes for 1.2         : fixed incorrect character in DECORATE definition
						  that was causing errors with recent ZDoom version.
						  Removed A_CustomMissile calls with undefined actor
						  AriCaseSmoke.
