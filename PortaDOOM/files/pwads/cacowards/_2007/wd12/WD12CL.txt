Wonderfull DooM I v.1.2

CHANGE LOG

I have made a lot of changes since WD1`s release on DW(now, it`s marked v.1.0)
There are changes in every map, so that they could look little more different from original. And because of that you must note: 
it`s absolutely INCOMPATIBLE with demos from elder version.

Most notable changes are in:
E1M1 - added some lighting and toxin pool outside, blue box with stairs is turned 90 degrees, in
last room 1 lattice wall is placed perpendiculary to exit door instead of 2 walls on each side
E1M2 - fixed crushing door in secret section
E1M3 - now there is a way out of north-eastern toxin pool
E1M5 - start section is different, exit is on other side of `dark sector`)
E1M7 - lots of small changes, including more complex secret in north section
E2M2 - player 1 start is now at opposite side
E2M4 - way to the big circle is different
E2M5 - south section with staircase is turned and now leading downwards
E2M7 - red key now is placed in a lowered techpillar with baron
E2M9 - now you must find exit of the red secret chamber
E3M1 - in a corridor with pinky`s the fork is added
E3M4 - all section before downward steps is mirrored
E3M7 - now bridges in the main hall are opposite and added 1 bridge in a middle
E3M9 - same changes like in E1M1
E4M5 - some architectural changes

About other changes.. well.. May be, it`s a reason to play wad again to see them all))..

P.S. `Wonderfull` means full of wonder )..
