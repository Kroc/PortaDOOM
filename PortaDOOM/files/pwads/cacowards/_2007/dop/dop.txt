Description             : A short trip through hell, set on by a classic
                          Doom story. Originally intended as just a Boom
                          compatible level, I got a little carried away
                          with it, especially the ending credits\scenes.
                          It carries in at over 10 Mb because of the
                          ambient sounds used... so turn off any music you
                          have playing, turn up the volume on other music
                          in ZDoom and enjoy!
                          If you want to know your kill percentage,
                          secrets found and playing time, wait until after
                          the ending credits.
                          This will run under GZDoom provided it supports
                          ZDoom r538's features, but some lighting will
                          look strange or too dark, no matter what setting.

Additional Credits to   : iori, DooMAD, playtesters, authors of resources
                          I borrowed (like Nigel "Enjay" Rowands'
                          splashes), Id software, the people of Townsville,
                          etc.
