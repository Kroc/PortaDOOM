Author's comment 	: Testing the gameplay on this proved to be a huge test 
			  of my patience. Change a few things, play the whole map
			  again. Repeat until everything is good, or close enough.
			  I hate Fraggle Script.

* Installation *
================================================================

1. Unzip in a directory where you have Doom Legacy and a Doom2.wad file installed.
2. Double click phobiata.cmd to run.

================================================================
* Gameplay modes *
================================================================

1. Chaos, most people will probably like this the most. Violence ahoy.

2. Myst, this is for those who like it mellow... I suppose.

3. War, best way to describe this would probably be, "infight hell".
	I don't think most people would favor this mode.

Base                    : From scratch
Editor(s) used 1st time : Deth 4.24, Zennode, BSP 5.0 wintex 4.3-4.7 and lvlinfo.
Editor(s) used 2nd time : Doombuilder, Zennode, Wintex 5.0, XWE
Known Bugs              : Due to Legacy using FS it's prone to fucking up. But I've
			  done the best I can to ensure that it won't. But still,
			  anomalities DO occur.

Development timeline	: Summer 2001 - Created Phobia during 2.5 months. People 
					rejoiced.
					One month later, patched Phobia to V 1.1
			  		
			  Winter 2001 - Worked on Phobia:Exodus during 1 month.

			  Spring 2002 - Worked on Phobia for a month then left it for 
					Island (Quake 2) (All this work I lost in a 
					HD crash)

			  Summer 2002 - Patched Phobia to v 1.2
					Finished up and released Ni'mrod. Rejoiced, 
					two. Then 
					decided Doom was over for me. People rejoiced.
					Declared Phobia:Exodus cancelled. 
					Disappointed, one.

			  Summer 2004 - Released all the resources for Phobia:Exodus 
					in June. Picked up the project in late July 
					decided to finish what was there now using DB 
					instead of DETH. (Why? I don't know.)
					After been working on it for 2 weeks, 
					contacted Marc about making the music.
					Change name to: Phobia - Chaos Legion

			  Fall   2004 - Regretted my decision to finish Phobia up, 
					as project had grown from 4 maps to 6. 
					Decided to stick with it because of substantial 
					ammount of work had been put into it from both 
					me and Marc's side. Changed name to: 
					Phobia - Chaos Dreams
					Doom3 was released, wanted to edit that instead.
					Changed name to: 
					Phobia - Fanatic Dreams

			  Winter 2004 - Asked Spike to help me with the Malleus statue 
					design.
					Project grew from 6 to 8 maps. Progress had 
					stagnated since October due to free time being 
					concentrated on Doom3 - Phobos instead.
					Changed name to: Phobia - Anarchy

			  Spring 2005 - Once again picked up Phobia with intent to 
					finish it.
					Asked Kaiser to help me finish "the badlands" 
					later decided to do it myself after all.
					Marc mailed me and motivated me further. 
					(Thanks Marc)
					Asked Manc to do voices. Asked AgentSpork 
					to betatest.
					Changed name to: 
					Phobia - The Age
					Marc offered to beta test, and sent in the 
					final two music tracks. Most of the maps 
					were now in general conception, finished. 
					Fixed a lot of small bugs.

			  Fall   2005 - After a summer of not touching it, once again 
					picked it up and contined to finish the last 
					unfinished map. (Map05 : Blood)
					Remade some of the graphics and also added a 
					lot of new. Replaced the Malleus statue with 
					my own design, and not Spikes (Sorry Spike).
					Performed hours of beta-testing.
					Compiled the entire package and sent out for 
					final beta-testing by Fanatic and Agent Spork.
					Got fed up with the beta testing procedeurs 
					and went back to work on Phobos (Doom3).
			
 			  Winter 2006 - Once again managed to get motivated and worked 
					over the thing placement on map05, had Agent 
					Spork test it out. Worked on Map06 and made 
					it complete. Also sent it to Agent Spork to test.
					Manc started to send in voices.
					Did last fine tuning of first 4 maps and made 
					to play through the entire wad on all settings.
					(Chaos, Myst and War)
			
    			  Spring 2006 - Finally everything was in place in the resource 
					wad. Only "War" left to test.
