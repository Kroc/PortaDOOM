Description             :  

First off, this mod isn't doom. So don't expect it to play like doom. Some of you will
like the playstyle, some of you will hate it.

A different kind of experience, focused more on puzzles and individual encounters. 
It is a remake of the first Phocas Island. I decided to do a remake because I felt
the first one was lacking in areas and was rushed towards the end. It features large
multi-path levels, with lots of scripting, not even one original monster (although some
are only slightly modified from the original).

You start off in an intro level which is where you'll choose the settings you want to
play with. Be sure to check the info switch, and if you can read the message on the wall
then your screen is brighter than the intended brightness. Having monster spawning on
adds a whole new level of difficulty to the maps and may not be suitable for the first 
playthrough. Beyond that, the 3 skill settings are self explanitory. Walk a bit passed 
the number to get an explaination. Walk into the darkness to select that skill. 

Be sure to bind the extra keys. Using the functions in the intro level will tell you what they 
do, except the grass effect. The grass toggle will turn on/off the grass effect which will
slow down older computers. On one map (map01: retreat) this will instead toggle
the trees. If you come across a rather large area without trees, then they are turned
off from using the grass effect toggle.

You may need a decent computer to run this. I tried to keep a high frame rate, but some
areas I couldn't help it.

General tips:
-Keep your eyes open. It's easy to miss an important cave/path if you are running around 
aimlessly.
-pay attention to your surroundings. Especially in boss fights you need to know where you can duck
behind a rock for cover.
-In boss fights, keep moving. Most bosses have attacks that rely on you staying still. Moving around a lot
will help you avoid these attacks. 
-Once you have a weapon that requires ammo, the ammo will regenerate over time, as long as you are moving.
-If it looks strange, try the 'use' key on it.
-You're first goal should be to find a weapon. 
-You have the choice of having extra monster spawning in as you play. This isn't recomended for the first play 
through. It is meant for giving more challenge after you are more familiar with the maps.
-There are two endings. The second, more hidden ending gives you more challenges along the way
 and is worth looking for.
-Candles are your source of health
