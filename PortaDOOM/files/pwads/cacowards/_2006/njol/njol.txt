* Further description and gameplay notes *


* Background *		  This is a level I did for a friend as part of our 
			  personal TC.  He specifically requested a level where
			  he "could do lots of sniping, hide behind stuff and 
			  fight enemies in depth positions where the enemies 
			  do not chase you all over the level".  Well, he got 
			  what he wanted.  As to whether this type of gameplay 
			  suits anyone else - who knows?
			  
			  The level has been taken almost directly from the TC
			  but has been "Doomified".  i.e. the TC weapons (bar 
			  one) are not present and the whole thing has been set up
			  slightly differently.  I thought about making it like a 
			  "Marine Assault 2" because the weapons and feel are 
			  similar, but I wanted try and convert some of the TC 
			  enemies to DECORATE rather than their original dehacked.
			  
			  The enemies are "Incas" or "Incanese".  These are from the 
			  A personal Role playing scenario.  In the year 2386, the 
			  Inca Free Republic attacked Britain without warning, against
			  all treaties and breaking many years of peace on planet 
			  Earth.  The IFR is far from free, however, they are a 
			  fascist dictatorship with unworldly connections to 
			  greater powers.
			  
			  None of that should be taken to infer any prejudice against
			  present day South American countries.  It's just a story - 
			  nothing to do with the real world.
			  
			  Of course this is all irrelevant to "Operation Overlord" 
			  because I have made it for a UAC marine rather than the a 
			  British Galactic Police Association (BGPA) officer from 
			  the original TC.
			  
			  Why did I go for the Incas rather than making it a more 
			  obvious WWII German mod?  I had the Inca sprites already, 
			  the level was set up for them, I wanted to use modern/ 
			  futuristic weapons and why not? That's how the original was
			  made. :P
			  


* Running *              :As usual, Unzip the files into and run with the -file parameter.
			  However, for the first section of the level I HIGHLY recommend
			  setting up an alias to zoom in on targets as a lot of the enemies 
			  are far away and you are provided with a railgun to snipe at them.
			  
			  If you want to use my alias, I have included a file "njol.cfg" you can
			  start the game using
			  
			  gzdoom +exec njol.cfg
			  
			  (or use the batch file if you have unzipped into your GZdoom directory)
			  
			  This will automatically load the WAD and set up a zooming 
			  alias.  If you do this, you should hit the X button in game to set
			  your preferred crosshair (I have included a few new ones).  If you
			  do not do this, your crosshair will get messed up when you zoom in.
			  
			  Once that is done, you will then be able to hit "Insert", "Home" and 
			  "PgUp" to toggle 2x, 5x and 12x zooming.  the "End" button resets to 
			  normal view.  These buttons can be re-configured via the menu.
			  
* Gameplay Notes *	 :Crouching and Jumping in this level are not only allowed, they
			  are highly recommended, if not essential.

			  This is not intended to be a typical Doom level.  You are supposed to 
			  sneak up the beach using the cover provided whilst sniping at the 
			  enemies.  If that isn't to your taste, you probably won't like this 
			  mod.  It wasn't made for you anyway. :P
			  
			  Seriously, just running in and blasting away will get you killed.
			  
* The sections *	 :There are kind-of 3 sections to the level: the initial beach assault,
			  the trenches and towers and the final bunker complex.

			  The beach area is the area where you will have to go cautiously. Use 
			  the beach defences to hide from enemy fire, pop out, snap off a 
			  shot and get back in cover.
			  
			  Once you clear the beach, there is a quick dash across a minefield 
			  which is covered by heavy machine-gun fire.  You can shoot the 
			  machine gunners but it won't be long before they get reinforced.
			  Once you have passed the minefield (the music will change) the 
			  machine gunners will no longer get reinforced and you can go back 
			  and kill them permanently if you want.
			  
			  The trenches and towers are more traditional Doom gameplay in style
			  but you will still need to keep your wits about you because there are
			  lots of machine gunners in defended alcoves.  At the top of each tower 
			  is a key.  You can go into the towers in any order you wish.
			  
			  The bunker complex is a repetitive room to room clearing operation.
			  You may or may not enjoy it, but it's exactly what my friend asked 
			  for, so he got it.
			  
* Special Equipment *    :In overlord, you can find 2 inventory items: Grenades and Portable 
			  Health packs

			  Grenades come as single pick-ups or in boxes of 5.  Some enemies also
			  drop them.  To use, ready them in the inventory and hit enter.  Grenades
			  (except the ones dropped by enemies) can always be picked up but the 
			  maximum inventory amount is 25.  If you are carrying 25, do not pick 
			  any up until you have used some otherwise the pickup will be wasted.
			  
			  Portable Health Packs are identifiable by the green cross on them. In
			  stead of being used instantly, they get added to your inventory and will
			  give you up to 25% health back as and when you choose to use it.

		  
* New Weapons *		  The BFG has been changed to a rail gun.  This allows the sniping which is
			  quite important for this level and the old BFG behaviour is not so useful.
			  
			  A DECORATE Thompson has been added.  It's really an Easter Egg as much as
			  anything else.  Clearly this level is inspired by WWII games like
			  MoHAA so it was a bit of fun to add a Thompson.  It's no shabby weapon
			  though and is probably a slightly more powerful weapon than the chaingun.
