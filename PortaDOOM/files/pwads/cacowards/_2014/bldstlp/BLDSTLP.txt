Description             : 


     10 level's wad for boom.The action takes place in the modern world of alternative
reality.
 
     Large multinational corporation, known as UAC, conducts secret research in the field
of moving through space and time, in the industrial area of a huge steel plant. One fine 
sunny morning, an emergency situation occurs, causing the whole area to be infected with a
deadly virus, the entire staff dies, and demonic hordes appeared from nowhere. Fortunately,
our hero has been away on some business with his work, and he hasn't been exposed to that
virus.
 
     At this point, he just came back, and he was covered with echoes of that cataclysm
that happened so untimely. He lost his consciousness and when he awoke, he realized that 
he was on a small island in the middle of acid puddles, in a garbage pit. It is necessary 
to enter the territory of metallurgical factory "Red Cacodemon " before sunset, and to 
find out, what exactly happened there.
