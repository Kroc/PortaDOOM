                          Special thanks to Rustking, as without him the wad would
                          be of considerably less quality and quantity, and progress
                          would have been much slower than it already was. Much extra time
                          and effort went into the wad itself from him, even though
                          he only made one map.

                          Thanks also to the input and regularity of the external
                          testing team including Rustking, Mobius, John Zombie,
                          Combinebobnt, Catastrophe, and Water.

                          We apologize to any possible individuals whose
                          resources were used but who were not credited in the
                          above list.
