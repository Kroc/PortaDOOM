Story

Your life before this point was spent in the hell that is Basildon, where the women are orange and where driving badly apparently is the law. Life sucks but you get by. On what seems a normal night, your slumber is disturbed by the groans and howls of demonic forces. You wake to find that you have been taken from your bed. You now sit surrounded by creatures you cannot describe, all you know is that for some reason they want to skin you alive and stuff you to serve your new leader laying face down in front of a door. Because even in hell you get drafts.
You notice the sky here is orange, how fitting.........
