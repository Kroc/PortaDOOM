Description		: An episode 3 replacement for Heretic, playing on the story
			  of Corvus' exile as he was under the curse of D'sparil.
			  
			  Read the back story under "Info" in Heretic.

Author droning on	: This project was all about having fun with making the maps
like Cosby on crack	  and resources. I didn't bother second guessing myself (that
			  doesn't mean that I didn't still make use of critical thinking 
			  though) and I think the project is better for it. 

			  The mantra was that I worked on it because I wanted to, everytime.
			  It wasn't about making every room the best it could be, but to 
			  not get caught up on meaningless details. If I wanted to feel like
			  I made progress, I would just push ahead and make a room. 
			  If it wasn't too bad, I'd keep it. (in other words, most of the time)
				
			  Actually. This is the first multilevel wad I make myself that isn't
			  a TC/PC. I suppose it's about time.

			  Actually, I've been thinking of making an Heretic wad for some years
			  now. I even did consider to make Phobia (The age) for Heretic. But
			  for whatever reason I can't recall now, I decided against it.
			  Probably thought tha the cartoony aspect of Heretic would blend
			  poorly with Phobia's direction. Or maybe it was because I had already
			  used Doom resources for a few things in Phobia, and didn't care to
			  remake them.

			  Either way, here is my Heretic wad, finally. If you've actually
			  bothered to read this far, thanks.

Additional Credits to	: -My brother Karl for making the Secret map and testing it 
			   all in Coop with me.
			  -Khorus, Udderdude for beta testing.
			  -Creaphis for his hcount.wad, which I used as base 
			   when I made the conveyorbelt scripts.
			  -Gez for finding a bunch of bugs in the original release and telling me about them.
			  -John Romero for Heretic and Hexen.
			  -ID and Raven of course for the games.

Sounds                 	: No
Music                  	: Yes (Rearranged Heretic music for great effect and JUSTICE)
Graphics               	: Yes
Hehacked Patch     	: No
Demos                  	: No


* Play Information *

Game                   	: Heretic
Map #                  	: E3M1-E3M9 (Notice: In most source ports, E3M4 is replaced with E3M4P in
			  the level progression. However, if you just warp to 3 4 using the
			  engage## or in the command line. You'll end up in the HereticP version
			  of the map. To warp directly to E3M4P, either use the consol, or with 
			  the command-line if you use a port that support MAPINFO use the command 
			  "+map e3m4p")
Single Player          	: Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player 	: Yes (Tested with 2 players, Survival mode included)
Deathmatch 2-4 Player	: No
Difficulty Settings    	: Yes
			  If you only want to enjoy the maps and play resonably carelessly
			  through the episode. I suggest one of the easier skill levels. 
			  Skill 3 "Bringest them oneth" is made to be casual but still offer 
			  something of a challenge.
			  Skill 4 "Thou art a smite-meister" has been tested to be aggressive 
			  and very challenging. (In other words. I died a lot while testing 
			  these maps in this skill level).
			  Skill 5 "Plack plague possesses thee" obviously largely the same as
			  skill 4, however. For those who may complain about Skill 4 not having 
			  enough ammo.

* Construction *

Base                   	: From scratch
Build Time             	: On and off for about a year
Editor(s) used         	: DB, DB2, DETH, XWE, ZENNODE.
May Not Run With...     : Non-Heretic source ports and any VPO limited Heretic versions.
Known Bugs             	: None that are serious, but here's a list.

			  **In Legacy and HereticP**
			  1. In some maps (E3M4 and E3M8), if you turn on No clipping mode before 
			  moving at all, it will cause the conveyorbelt scripts to not activate.
						  
			  **In Legacy (software) and HereticP**			  
			  2. In some maps the bottom of the sky can be spotted, and 
			  there's a tutti frutti effect there because Vanilla Heretic 
			  doesn't allow Vertical wrapping of the sky texture, and 
			  Legacy copied this behaviour for some reason.

			  **In Legacy and Eternity**
			  3. The level name will not be showing up properly at the 
			  'now entering' screen. It will show up in the Automap and in the 'finished'
			  though.  It just hasn't loaded the next map yet and as such, neither the 
			  [level info] information that is embedded in the ExMx lump.
				
			  **In Vavoom and Legacy OpenGL mode**
			  4. In some place there'll be visual glitches where sector draw hacks 
			  have been used.

			  **In HereticP**
			  5. Sometimes when changing from one map to another HereticP can run out 
			  of allocated memory and crash. To not lose progress, make sure you save 
			  before exiting the map.

Doomsday support	: Most of the maps do work in Doomsday, but at the time of writing, Doomsday
			  does not support Voodoo dolls, and a couple of the maps require this to function.
			  These maps are. E3M4 and E3M8
			  This has been promised to be fixed in future versions though.
