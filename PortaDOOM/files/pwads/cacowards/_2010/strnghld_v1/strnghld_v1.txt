Description             : You know Doom, it is always the same, get some weapons, 
			  infiltrate the destroyed UAC base or demon hive, kill 
			  all the monsters and hellspawn and find the exit switch. 
			  This was Doom... until now: Stronghold is a mixture of 
			  Unreal Tournament's Assault mode and Skulltag's Invasion 
			  mode. Defend your Stronghold against hundreds of monsters, 
			  divided into several waves. Earn points, get rewards between 
			  waves and let no single enemy pass! 

GZDoom Settings		: Lighting Mode MUST be "Standard" style
