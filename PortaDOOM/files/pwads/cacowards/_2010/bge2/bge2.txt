                          Oh hey look, release date is exactly 1 year since
                          E1!

Description             : Another 8 vanilla compatible levels set on the
                          moon Ganymede. For your average skill level
                          Doomer (you all hit UV anyway), but speedrunners
                          have certainly been catered for as well!
                          
                          Note that while I haven't disabled jump or crouch
                          in a mapinfo lump (I prefer to let the player do
                          whatever they choose), it's possible they'll
                          break the maps. I've tried to prevent this where
                          possible, but some areas would require too much
                          work for it. And remember to choose Episode 2,
                          not 1, when playing...

                          A big thanks to the testers, every one did an
                          awesomepants job. I hope the extra attention to
