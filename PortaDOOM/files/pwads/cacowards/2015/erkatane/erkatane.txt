Misc. Author Info       : I'm a 32 years old doomer, I make maps when it's 
			  possible for me because most of the time I'm busy 
			  with other stuff. beyond that I keep interested on 
                          everything related to doom, I believe mapping is
                          a true art which requires lots of effort, 
                          motivation and skills.

Description             : The main goal was to create a vanilla classic 
                          episode themed on Doom2 techbases. I was as well 
                          influenced by d2twid and 1994-1996 maps regarding 
                          to the very raw detailing employed. The maps are 
                          small to mid in size and the average enemy count 
                          is around 100 per map. There is virtually no 
                          texture alignment except for some doors and 
                          switches, taking advantage of the sector height 
                          sometimes for that work, and I made no use of 
                          support2/3 to separate different textures, using 
                          just angles as in some iwad maps. On the other 
                          hand I wanted very consistent themes so I used 
                          just 40 different textures per map as a 
                          constraint, including those for doors and keymarks
                          as I realised some iwad maps use very few 
                          textures too.

                          This Wad additionally comes with erkaknee.wad
                          a complete conversion of the main episode to
                          the "knee deep in the dead" theme. I used just
                          the shareware flats and textures, just as I did
                          with the favillesco episode 1, so no crates,
                          compohso, gray, support3 or other textures
                          we often see in E1 styled maps, nothing wrong
                          with that, but I wanted to keep the vibe as
                          close as possible to the original episode,
                          although theese layouts weren't conceived as
                          E1 maps. The conversion process was painfully
                          surgical, I replaced all the flats and textures
                          manually -not by a software 1 to 1 replace tool- 
                          because I had to rethink from scratch what E1 
                          textures and flats would suit the preexisting
                          rooms.

Known Bugs              : Map09 may crash on vanilla  when crossing some 
                          linedefs due to very tall sectors. 
                          I'd recommend saving before taking big jumps,
                          otherwise it's fully compatible.

                          another port, blame that port, because
                          this is a vanilla wad ;) ).
