Wad Info	        : This WAD tells the true story of what REALLY happened in the 
			  recent episode at the NewDooM forums.  My sources are infallible, 
			  so don't even try to dismiss any of this as false, because it is 
			  the cold, hard truth and it will hit you like a speeding bus in 
			  the middle of a rainy night.  It's that powerful.
			  
			  Due to the veracity of the story it required a great deal of 
			  resources, and thusly this WAD is a great deal larger than the 
			  previous two, not only in size of file, but magnitude of story.  
			  There is a short graphical novella in the beginning which is 
			  also MAP01.  I suggest that you watch it, but you may skip it at 
			  any time by pressing the 'use' button.
                          
Source Port		: You need ZDooM 2.0, a fine source port.  You may obtain a copy of 
			  it here: http://zdoom.org/

Known Bugs              : In one of the final battles there's a portal (you'll know it when 
			  you see it) that will break on you.  It should work, but I'm 
			  smarter than ZDoom, so it breaks after a while.  Too bad, it's 
			  a cool effect so it stays in there.  I'd also advise against 
			  gamesaves or cheating in that area for related reasons.
