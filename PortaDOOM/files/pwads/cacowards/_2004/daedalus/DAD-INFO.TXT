1. ANNOUNCEMENT
---------------

            TeamTNT proudly announces the release of

                   +-------------------------+
                   | Daedalus: Alien Defense |
                   +-------------------------+

Daedalus is the long-awaited sequel to Icarus: Alien Vanguard.
It was originally planned for release as DOOM2000 on 1/1/2000,
and has been anticipated by players, and the developers have
suffered/enjoyed every minute of the subsequent nearly 4 
years.

It has been released on 3dgamers, and within 4 hours of release
should be showing up on the mirrors.  

Daedalus requires the latest version of ZDoom (2.0.60 as of this
writing) and if you don't have that you'll need to go to the
ZDoom.org web site, Downloads link, and you'll find it there 
under the 2.xx releases.  You also need either DOOM2.WAD, TNT.WAD
or PLUTONIA.WAD (the latter two part of Final DOOM) to play
Daedalus.

Daedalus is a single-player, puzzle/action based game.  There are
no multiplayer starts, either cooperative or deathmatch.

Features:

 - A full compliment of four hubs and a finale
 - Each hub contains up to 7 levels, logically intertwined 
 - Music by Rich Nagel
 - Over 1200 completely new textures
 - Cohesive theme and storyline
 - All difficulty levels, including monster randomization
 - New monsters and a new weapon



---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------

Daedalus comes in one WAD file, zipped into one ZIP file.  You'll
need PKUNZIP.EXE or an equivalent unzipping utility to unpack
DAEDALUS.ZIP.  This will produce DAEDALUS.WAD and another copy 
of this file.

Just unzip it into your DOOM2 directory and run it with ZDoom.
This command line should work, or you can drag and drop 
DAEDALUS.WAD on the ZDoom icon.

  zdoom daedalus

3. TROUBLESHOOTING
------------------

Not much can go wrong, since this is just one WAD file.  However,
since not much can go wrong, something might, and maybe a few
steps here will help.

a.  First, verify that DAEDALUS.WAD is in the same directory as
    DOOM2.WAD (or TNT.WAD or PLUTONIA.WAD), and that you've got
    all the files that came with ZDoom installed.  

b.  If it starts up and crashes with a message similar to

      "Demo is from a different version"

----------------------
4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
----------------------

   Well, Daedalus is pretty intensive in some places.  You'll 
   need to decide how you want to configure your video resolution
   and special features in ZDoom to match the machine you're 
   running on.  Generally all that will happen is that it'll be
   rather choppy sometimes, and it may depend on which direction 
   you're looking (transparent object, lots of fireballs(!) and
   so forth can make a difference.

   It runs fine on a 400MHz Pentium II, though as developers some
   of us have spoiled ourselves and have higher-end machines.
   You probably won't be able to use this as an excuse for a new
   computer, in other words.

   But the bigger the better.  It's really nice at 1280x1024 on
   a 2.6GHz P4 :)

   The WAD file is a bit over 50MB.  It zips up smaller, but 
   dialup users are going to need to plan for the experience.

5. WHERE TO GET FILES
---------------------

   Daedalus:  Alien Defense was uploaded to the archives at
   3dgamers.com at 9:00PM CST on DOOM's 10th birthday,
   December 10, 2003.  After 10 days in the Newstuff directory,
   it will be moved into the TeamTNT directory under themes.

   We will maintain a link on our web page to the primary 
   download site on in-span.net once it's there.

6. HOW TO GET HELP
------------------

   If it's about ZDOOM itself, go to the forums on zdoom.org

   If it's about Daedalus, there are lots of places to go,
   including but not limited to writing to us at TeamTNT.  There
   are forums at Doomworld that we will monitor, as well as on
   Zdoom.org.  There probably are going to be a bunch of people
   in the community playing this at once, so try to get peer
   help first.

   We won't give you hints via email.  Just don't even try... :)

   We'll be putting a FAQ out too, and that'll answer some of
   the more common questions
