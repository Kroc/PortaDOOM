Description             : Project MSX is a gameplay mod that blends the best of both modern and 
			old-school FPS shooty action. Bringing a gameplay that is both tactical and fast
			paced. The player is now equiped with an awesome power suit that will give 
			him/her new powers that must be mastered in order to survive. 
			
			Is recomended that you use GZDoom to run this mod, since it uses a
			lot of truecolor graphics with transparency that simply won't
			display as intented if you run it in software mode.
			
			Widescreen is now supported :)

Author note		: Beta 2 comes out more than a year and half later after the Beta 1, 
			AND past my June 30th deadline... Goddamn I suck
