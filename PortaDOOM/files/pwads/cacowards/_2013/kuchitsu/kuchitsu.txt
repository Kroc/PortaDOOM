Description             : 6 easy (for me anyway) levels intended to be
                          played on UV from pistol start without saves. I
                          didn't consider continuous playing while making
                          this wad. The general theme is green/brown bricks
                          and nature with some city and tech elements.

Additional Credits to   : Graphic and music makers, authors of things that 
                          inspired me. (see below for the details) GreyGhost 
						  for removing unused graphics. Players from Doomworld
						  and Russian Doom Community for feedback, FDAs and 
						  let's plays. The author of "DoomWord" (sic). Sorry 
						  dude, forgot to credit you in my previous wads.

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : I dunno, but the first completed map (05) was
                          started on October 13, 2011 and the last
                          completed map (06) was finished just a few days
                          ago.
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder 1.68, XWE
Known Bugs              : On map05 the blue door looks incorrectly in some
                          ZDoom-based ports. But they aren't vanilla
                          compatible so you're not supposed to use them
                          anyway. :p
May Not Run With...     : doom2.exe (even if you append new sprites and
                          flats, you might get HOMs, visplane errors,
                          tutti-fruttis and medusas)

     New music:
map01 - map09 from Gothic DM, composed by Mark A. Klem
map02 - map01 from The Waterfront, presumably composed by Scott F. Crank but it is not written in the *.txt for that wad
map03 - map09 from Requiem, composed by David "Tolwyn" Shaw
map04 - map16 from Memento Mori 2, composed by David "Tolwyn" Shaw
map05 - map01 from Doom City, composed by Shamus Young
map06 - "Wily's Fortress: Station 2" from Mega Man 7 (SNES), midi version by Jarel Jones
intermission - "Instructions / Password" from Pilotwings (SNES), midi version by Chris Francis 
story - map01 from Osiris, composed by Jeremy Doyle

     Sources of inspiration:
map01 - texturing: 2dmmaps.wad map01, the tower you can see from the exit: Eternal's wads
map02 - lighthouse: wtrfront.wad, boats: Alien Vendetta map11
map03 - "Doom 2 the Way id Did" (big part of this map was originally made for that project 
         but they said that it wasn't very id-like and I didn't want to change anything), the red key area: Doom 2 map06
map04 - first few areas: Cleimos 2, texturing: Scythe 2, last area: Whispers of Satan, green armor behind the red laser: Epic 2
map05 - Doom City of course, it inspired the whole wad basically
map06 - Scythe 2 map11, rocket launcher area: Alien Vendetta, scapeship at the end: Escape from Deimos

     Name of the wad: I listened to the song Blood Stain Child - Ez Do Dance (TRF Cover), heard "kuchitsu" at 1:31 
                  and liked how it sounded. It's not a proper word, just a combination of syllables.
				  
     Map name explanations:
map01 - "IKUWAYO"            - it's from Japanese language, a girly way to say "Let's go!"
map02 - "LOTUS ISLAND"       - Buckethead has a song with the same name, this map takes place on an island
map03 - "MECHANICAL"         - no idea, I guess I was just thinking of random words and this one seemed fitting
map04 - "WATER LEAK"         - umio has a song with the same name, there is a lot of water in this map
map05 - "DOOM TOWN"          - uhhh it's similar to "Doom City"!
map06 - "HAVE A NICE FLIGHT" - at the end you're boarding a spaceship and the intermission music is from a flight simulator

... I enjoyed writing all this stuff for some reason.
