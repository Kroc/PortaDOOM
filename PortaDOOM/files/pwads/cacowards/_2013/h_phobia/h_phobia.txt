* Back Story *

It's some years after Hell on Earth. You prevented the demonic invasion and the
threat has subsided. The UAC has been greatly discredited as a result of the
catastrophes on Phobos, Deimos and Earth. After completing a contract to eradicate
the sporadic remaining factions of Hell their military funds are removed and their
remit restricted to researching advancements in treating those suffering combat
fatigue from the invasion. Those who had survived close encounters with the
Spider Masterminds had particulary acute symptoms of hysteria. After alerting your
Commanding Officer to your horrifying premonitions of a new attack from Hell you
are referred to the UAC who diagnose you with the new condition: Hadephobia...
