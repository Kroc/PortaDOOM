Misc. Author Info       : Still making Doom maps.

Description             : This map is one of the many parts of the Secret
                          Santa Imitation Project, led by Brian "Snakes"
                          Knox. It was meant to imitate the style of Chris
                          "lupinx-Kassman" Kassap, and is designed for
                          Single Player, Co-op, and Deathmatch play.
                          
                          A lonely medieval outpost overlooking a large sea
                          sits on the edge of the world. In it lies a
                          magical sword of power, waiting to be taken by a
                          brave adventurer. But be warned - rumor has it
                          that the sword was sealed away in order to keep
                          an alleged curse placed on it at bay...

Additional Credits to   : - Brian "Snakes" Knox for the opportunity to
                            create a map in a style that I'm not accustomed
                            to.
                          - lupinx-Kassman for having a somewhat imitatable
                            style.
                          - James Paddock for the song "Fallen Sun".

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : A couple months, spread out over half a year,
                          unfortunately.
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder 2, SLADE 3, TexSpy, TEXtract, 
                          Notepad++, DoomMerge
Known Bugs              : Some textures that are impossible to align. There
                          may be some places I call "Node Holes" where, due
                          to the complexity of the node tree, may create
                          places that stop the player. They are in
                          out-of-the-way areas, but they may pop up in one
                          or two places.
May Not Run With...     : Non-Boom-compatible Source Ports
Other                   : If you play using ZDoom, the game will end after
                          MAP01. Nothing is replaced past that point.

                          A postmortem of the design process in in a file
                          called "postmort.txt", included in this archive.
