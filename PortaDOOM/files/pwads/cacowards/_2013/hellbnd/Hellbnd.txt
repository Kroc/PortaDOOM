Description             : 32 map megawad with collections of maps made from different periods of my
			  doom mapping hobby, along with new ones. All old maps are re-polished to make them
			  consistent in look with the newer ones.
			  Maps are "progressively" chained together (so the previous map's end is
			  more or less linked to the next one's start). Difficulty is medium, sometimes hard,
			  but not insane. Experienced players can do it in UV without any problem.

			  HBFM29.wad: the full version of MAP29. Load this if you think your port/computer
			  can handle the awesomeness (or laggyness) of it. Barely any gameplay difference, though.

Story/Notes   : 
===========================================================================

Story:

You are called into service from your home late at night. Even though you retired as a combatant -
all those hellish invasions were enough for now - UAC seems to need your talents again. You grab your
pistol you keep at home, and realize what is going on again as you hear a familiar growl from the
corridor. Time to put that demon-slaying experience into action again...


- MAP01 - Apartments - Difficulty: Easy
You awake in the middle of the night as a desperate UAC message gets through on your communication devices.
UAC installed plenty of hardware in your home for a situation just like this. You head out to the infested
streets to reach the nearest UAC installation.

Author's Notes: This is a quite old map, but it looked decent without much overhauling needed. It was started
with an old DOS editor, and finished in DoomBuilder 2. It was kind of a shot at a "scary city map".

- MAP02 - Canal Road - Difficulty: Easy
Your path leads you through the treacherous canals, now overrun with undead and demons. Beware of the water
below, industrial waste is known to be flushed into it. That UAC base is nearby, hopefully it is able to hold
the invasion and you can meet some reinforcements there.

A.N.: MAP01's continuation. This map was inspired by Deus Ex 1's Hong Kong Canal map. It contains a relatively
tricky secret, hopefully not too obscure :)

- MAP03 - Testing Chambers - Difficulty: Easy
Arriving at the base you only find a few wandering zombies. No guards outside, dead crew inside. Looks like 
no reinforcements again. The place was invaded from the inside. You wonder what's beyond those metal detectors 
you were never admitted past...

A.N.: I made this a bit later now with Doom Builder, in fact if I recall correctly this was my first Doom Builder
map. The style was an absolute mish-mash, it has been re-done in a greyish UAC base style, but it remains varied
enough.

- MAP04 - Processing Plant - Difficulty: Easy
The only way out was to go deeper into an industrial plant. This place is devoid of any light and likely infested
with hellspawn. Green radioactive waste is being poured inside the pipes here. You hope it leads somewhere.

A.N.: This map is inspired by Doom3's waste processing maps, in fact the Mancubus Room is almost directly taken
from there. Contains a "hell-trip", where you get teleported to a small hellish section (only 1 player in Co-op).

- MAP05 - Underground - Difficulty: Medium
You are surprised to see the UAC having secret enterances in the underground railway system. Nevertheless you
learn from computers that a so-called Gateway (a high-powered teleporter) is located inside. You need to locate
the key that unlocks the path leading to it. You suspect it might have gotten lost somewhere in the underground
system during the invasion.

A.N.: An old subway themed map, extensively polished up, into almost an entirely new map. The style is 
in-line with MAP01 and MAP02. The station and railway parts are only slightly updated, as is the park, but 
the rest is almost brand new. Contains city vistas that were put in during the first re-polishing phase.

- MAP06 - Gateway Lab - Difficulty: Medium
You descend through the eerie layers of infested ooze into what you guess is a highly secret UAC facility.
It seems to be sealed off and almost empty, but you suspect a nasty ambush.

A.N.: This map was pretty small and non-interesting, so it was overhauled HEAVILY. I took inspiration from E2M4.
The Ammo Storage and the Med Bay remained in. I varied with the linearity of the gameplay, and finally settled for
allowing players to clear the majority of the map before getting the keys.

- MAP07 - Woods - Difficulty: Easy
You enter into the swirling madness of the Gateway, wondering where it will take you. Seems like most of
your equipment ended up being someplace else, so you'll have to do with the pistol you found lying on a dead body.
According to the nearby computers you are far away from your home city, underneath a small patch of forest. The
map shows several interconnecting UAC facilities nearby. You suspect the source of the invasion might be in one of
them.

A.N.: A forest map. Inspired by Shadow Warrior's forest map. The start area is a newly added Quake-ish/E2-ish
style underground base. The gameplay of this map was quite different from how it is now. It was not intended to
be a MAP07, so the 666 and 667 features were not in originally. Note that the 667 tag works differently on some
ports, but the map is playable with both 64 and 128 raise on the tag.

- MAP08 - Military Depot - Difficulty: Medium
You spot the UAC base outside the woods. It seems to be locked down tightly and guarded by hellspawn, but you saw
an alternate entry: it has a sewage drain on the side. In fact that drain can lead you closer to the major UAC
base you saw on the map. Better clear this place out quick, and unlock the other end of that drain pipe.

A.N.: I almost threw this map away deeming it as not redeemable. It needed a style overhaul very badly. In the end
I kept it as it has some interesting areas. This is directly connected to both the last and the next map. During the
Second major overhaul the linearity has been dropped and now it can be cleared on multiple paths.

- MAP09 - Disposal Facility - Difficulty: Medium
Rivers of toxic waste flow across the landscape, courtesy of the UAC's waste management program. Those experiments
must require an awful lot of the gooey material. You must navigate the hazardous environment of the facility to
locate the way out. Be careful, the hellspawn seems to have something in store for you.

A.N.: A Duke Nukem-esque map (think E1L4 and E1L5), this one also contains a "hell-trip". The flow of the map was
slightly updated to contain more self-explanatory switches, since even when I replayed it after a while got lost.
The red key and it's function has also been redesigned.

- MAP10 - Cistern - Difficulty: Medium
Seems like the only way through the area is to go down to the cistern of the nearby UAC water treatment plant.
The place is crawling with monsters, but you intend to flush them out.

A.N.: One of the first maps where I started to get the importance of trim-textures and styling. It turned out
good enough, I only needed to replace a few ugly parts. A bit of a switch hunt map, although unreasonable
"switch opens something on the other end of the map" was reduced to as little as possible. Second overhaul
added some vine bits.

- MAP11 - Venom Canyon - Difficulty: Medium
A great divide lays before you. A smaller UAC complex must be crossed in order to get to the dam. Unfortunately
the road that leads to the main UAC base seems to be destroyed, so you'll have to climb your way throgh the
cliffs. Beware of the great slime river, it is poisonous to the touch.

A.N.: A partly Half-Life inspired map. It was a bit large and empty, so quite a bit of updating was needed to get
it into shape. The dam also received a facelift, as well as the compound before it. The second update wave touched
the Canyon part of it, greatly improving detail, and making the nukage river escapable.

- MAP12 - Power Station - Difficulty: Medium
You made it to the UAC base. This part seems to be a power station, you'll probably need to bring it on-line to
go any deeper. You smell the foul stench of demon infestation lingering in the air, so you prepare for a thorough
cleansing. Structural damage seems to be minimal on this part, but you wonder about the deeper sectors.

A.N.: A clear continuation of MAP12, and a sort of "prequel" to MAP13. From here on the demonic corruption fusing
with the techbase becomes apparent. The place becomes a bit brighter once you power up the reactor. This map was
also plagued by the "what did this switch do" problem, hopefully now it is much clearer.

- MAP13 - Encrus Station - Difficulty: Medium
The stench of corruption becomes ever more apparent here. Your train seems to be stopped by some hellish growth
on the rail, so you need to proceed on foot. The base seems quiet, but you know they are waiting. You also learn
that this sector contains experimental weapons, just the thing you need if you are going to face more hellspawn.

A.N.: The last of the "Half-Life Train" maps, this one contains some heavy infestation and a hellish part as well.
You also get your hands on the BFG. This map was the unfinished end of the Canyon-Power Station line. It was
originally called "InfeStation", but I dropped the name as it was also used in a SkullTag invasion map.

- MAP14 - Doom District - Difficulty: Hard
You are unsure whether you found the source of the demons or just a simple invasion teleporter left around by them.
You seem to emerge in a downtown area. The streets are dominated by infested military and spiders, but you are
ever ready should a major wave of hellspawn head this way. A large UAC building also seems to be nearby, might be
worth checking it out.

A.N.: A large cityscape map, left unfinished. Originally it was intended to be a co-op map. The city itself looked
decent, so not much alteration was needed to it, only expansion. It turned out to be a quite large map with a
relatively large number of monsters. You can litter the streets with corpses. Has an industrial area and the
UAC techbase-building. The second update wave added some damage to the city area, after all it's a hellish invasion.

- MAP15 - The Vault - Difficulty: Medium
The enterance to this facility was heavily infested by hell-growths, so you needed to enter through the ventillation
shaft. You learn that this place is a showcase of the successes UAC had with the teleport experimentations. Maybe
you'll find something useful here...

A.N.: A brand new map, with some Doom3 inspired areas. You proceed by opening blast doors to the next sections. Home
of the Demon Museum.

- MAP16 - City Bounds - Difficulty: Hard
You finally escape that horrid place, and see the eerie glow in the sky again. You seem to emerge at an emergency exit
in an aqueduct. The boundaries of the big city are nearby. You prepare for a bloody fight, as there's no telling how
much hellspawn has gathered outside while you were down below.

A.N.: Another new map, this time it is slightly Rage inspired. Beware the lots of cacodemons, they will literally fill
the skies. Also contains quite a few big baddies. Originally I was planning to put the Starport here, but the streets,
canals and highway zones turned out so large that I decided to make it a completely new map.

- MAP17 - Starport - Difficulty: Medium
Looks like this city has a starport nearby. UAC usually has important installations near such places, to make cargo
hauling easy. You need to gain enterance to that place, and you already see the way in, but it's unlikely this will
be that easy...

A.N.: Intended to fill the hole between the realistic MAP16 and the E1 style MAP18. For a long time I had no idea
what could accomplish this, but it seems like a Starport is a perfect map for this purpose.

- MAP18 - Computer Complex - Difficulty: Easy
This place looks familiar. You are not sure where you have seen places like this before, but you are content to push
on. You are finally on track towards the source, or maybe the demons are playing with your head.

A.N.: I was so eager to make something E1 style, so I did this map. Lots of E1 like areas. Maybe a tad bit dark for
E1, but I took a great attention to detail so it has E1 style textures. Contains only E1 monsters and some Doom2 ones
that I thought might fit the E1 style (Revenant, Hellknight, Chaingunner)

- MAP19 - Frontier Lab - Difficulty: Medium
More familiar areas. You are now sure the demons has something to do with it. This place seems so overrun and subverted
that you are not sure what it might contain. Computers tell you of an experimental type of gateway in the area.
Definitely a point of interest.

A.N.: The logical continuation of the E1 tribute, this is the E2 tribute, with some unique spins on the style.
Beware of ghost monsters created by the crushers and doorways (yup, quite a few archviles here)!

- MAP20 - Borderworld - Difficulty: Hard
You took the second gateway and ended up in some unknown place. It looks like the base was built by the UAC, but
Hell's powers have twisted it to a great extent. You learn, that this place is the frontier, where UAC tried to
take the fight to Hell, without success it seems. This is the borderworld between Hell and our dimension, a
failed expedition pioneered by the UAC's forces. Now you'll have to batter through the frontline of the
hellspawn and finish what UAC could not: reach the portal to Hell itself.

A.N.: A quite large and hard map. Main inspiration comes from The Ultimate Torment and Torture's second to
last map. Has a trench action part which was something I wanted to try.

- MAP21 - The Gates of Hell - Difficulty: Medium
This is it. Hell. You stand before the very gates of it. Your equipment has gone missing again, good thing you
see some supply crates nearby. The place looks deserted, but you know that hell never leaves it's doorstep unguarded.

A.N.: A quick map with a decent ambush scene. Inspired by Doom3's hell map as well as Quake3's Hell's Gate map.
This map has a custom midi made by combining the "Unused52" with MAP07's music.
I call this track "South of the Shotgun"

- MAP22 - Stygian Depths - Difficulty: Medium
You descend deeper into the fortress style building. The smell becomes even worse down here. Unknown depths lie
before you, but you are determined to get to the bottom of it.

A.N.: Another Doom3 inspired area, with the "descending cage" scene, and a darker, more cavernous place. Made
with the intent to make hell not only fire and brimstone, but a bit of slimy and dark as well.

- MAP23 - Fortress of Ages - Difficulty: Hard
As you emerge on the other side of the unholy pits, the view of a large fortress in a lava filled valley comes
into view. It seems like this place has gathered aeons of dust and decay, and the bones of the fallen from many
generations ago. Horrible monsters roam the area, you need to find a safe place, but there's none nearby.

A.N.: The odlest map in the pack, renewed, and made much more hellish. The goodie columns are quite optional,
the map contains plenty of ammunition otherwise, but you can stock up on rockets that way.

- MAP24 - City of Pandemonium - Difficulty: Hard
You wonder what kind of place you are going to enter through a sewer filled with blood. Seems like the demons
also have a place to live somewhere, or the denizens of Hell are put into large blockhouses. The place is probably
crawling with demons, so you better tread carefully. One one positive note, the blood seems not to be hazardous
to health.

A.N.: A new map. I wanted to try some really hellish and weird cityscape map, and this came to be the result.
Lots of monsters, but also lots of ammo and health.

- MAP25 - Bastion of Void - Difficulty: Hard
Reluctantly plunging into the fiery hole, you find yourself someplace else. This area of hell seems to be out in
the nothingness. You don't expect it, however, to be empty, judging by the animalistic sounds nearby. Bones of
the dead are stored here, for reasons you don't want to discover. Hell seems to be playing a game with you, and
you are lost without a hope.

A.N.: An other old map, renewed and expanded. The original old map is the center part, it was a castle floating in
space. Plenty of Cyb's Void inspired areas here, though I had to invisible-wall off the void pits, due to falling
damage or such not existing in vanilla conditions.

- MAP26 - Forbidden Archives - Difficulty: Hard
Compared to the nasty Bastion you just escaped from, this place actually looks nice and welcoming. You know that
this should not fool you, and you are determined to play Hell's game. Whatever they throw at you can be overcome by
good old fashioned firepower, right? At some point they should run out of reinforcements...

A.N.: Two things were in mind when designing this map: water and library. Those two unrelated concepts spawned this
level. It is mostly symmetric. Some Doom64 inspirations here.

- MAP27 - Crimson Abyss - Difficulty: Hard
From water you tread into blood again. So much blood, you feel the warmth of it embracing you, it almost feels good.
'Am I going crazy?' - you ask yourself. Still this building covered in ludicrous amounts of blood seems to be the
only way. Some of it is visible from where you stand, but more is hidden deep below the floating lake of blood.

A.N.: This is a sumberged style map, inspired by Enclave's underwater level, except it is in hell, so water is
replaced with blood. I played with a lot of blood-stained textures. The structure itself is split between a wood
and a marble part.

- MAP28 - The Black Citadel - Difficulty: Medium
You arrive in the gatehouse of a dark hellish fortress. You are getting more and more convinced, that Hell has not
counted on you getting this far. This fortress was built to withstand massive assaults, but you feel unstoppable.
If you have to clear every corner of Hell, so be it.

A.N.: This map has a very mixed inspiration source. Probably the Doom64 or the Quake feeling prevails

- MAP29 - Ascension - Difficulty: Very Hard
Passing the Black Citadel you arrive at an ominous looking mountain fitted with a fortress. The top of this fortress
contains a peculiar column of flesh, you suspect it might be something important. Slowly you prepare for the fight
ahead, such a large and strange fortress must be heavily guarded.
Once the first gunshot is fired and you hear the echo of the roar of thousands of demons. You are in for one hell of
a hillclimb.

A.N.: This took a looong time to make, and has a ginormous amount of things that show at the same time (due to being
a very open map).
Inspirations include: UTNT's last map (being a hillclimb and the ominous column always visible), Diablo2's Chaos
Sanctuary (layout of the final arena, general feeling), Serious Sam SE: Grand Cathedarl (long slaughter corridors)

- MAP30 - Worlds Collide - Difficulty: Very Hard
Sweat and blood pouring from every part of your body, you jump into the flesh column, and get transported to some
kind of hellish staging area. Ahead, you see a giant portal.
It is your exit from hell, and also the demons' enterance to earth. On the other side, hellspawn are preparing to
set up a demon spawner in our world. If it activates, earth is surely doomed. More so than how it is already at least...

A.N.: Originally I wanted to make this map take place in the depths of hell, but I heard people liked MAP14's cityscape
and it kinda became an icon for the wad, so the idea came to me to make a hybrid map, having hell zones and a city part
as well as an invasion frontier setting.
I think for a MAP30 the gameplay is pretty good. You get plenty of BFG cells to melt away the horde spawned by the 5
Icons, also there is more than enough room not to get cornered. In the final arena, the 4 Cyberdemons can help you
thin out the crowd (they follow you there BTW!)

- MAP31 - Diabolus Ex Machina - Difficulty: Hard
Just what is this place you stubled upon? Is it some virtual reality? It seems to be invaded by Demons, so you better
clear it out...

A.N.: Inspired by MAP31 of Speed of Doom, except I wanted some hellish twist into it. It is a virtual reality like
setting invaded by hell. Has some pretty crowded actions...

- MAP32 - Spear of Destiny - Difficulty: Medium
You are not only unsure where you are, but also when. You hear german talking nearby...

A.N.: I wanted to use Wolf textures and SS nazis. That's it.
