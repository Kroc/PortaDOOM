* What's new in 1.1???

-Ammo and health additions across the board
-Various enemy placement tweaks
-Additional health for lower difficulties
-The mass wizard trap in e1m6 has been reworked a bit,
they now teleport in rapidly rather than having them all bunched up
in one area from the start.
-The unpowered Gold Wand now fires slightly faster like it did when
powered up, and accordingly the powered up wand now fires slightly faster.
-The speed of D'Sparil's lightning ball has been greatly increased.
-The crossbow ammo that Weredragons drop no longer give 10, they now give 5 LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT THE HECK MAN.
-Replaced the Dragon Claw in front of the gold key door in E1M2 with a Phoenix Rod.
-Some other minor crap
