Primary purpose         : Single play
Advanced engine needed  : None for E1-E4; playing E5 and E6 ingame requires
                          either ZDoom or Eternity, though E5 is available
                          as a separate add-on (DTWID-E5.wad) for vanilla.
                          DTWID-LX.wad contains unmodified, original
                          versions of some maps, which may not be 100%
                          vanilla compatible, so be warned there.

Description             : Six episodes of classic Doom maps, originally
                          candidates for last year's "Doom the Way Id
                          Did", arranged in an episodic format.

                          DTWID was a long but fruitful journey, with
                          somewhere around a hundred map submissions in
                          total. Given the strictness of the rules, most
                          of the maps cut were not done so for reasons
                          of quality. On their own they're quite
                          solid maps, deserving their own showcase.
                          This collection, while not 100% complete,
                          contains the vast majority of submissions
                          to the project.

                          Episodes 1-3 are an alternate take on the
                          idea of Doom the Way Id Did, three sets of
                          maps arranged to mimic id's original episodic
                          styles. Several maps in these sets were
                          very close contenders to the main project,
                          excluded only because of withdrawals or
                          episode length limits. You may be hard-
                          pressed to find a difference in quality!

                          Episode 4 follows partially in the same vein,
                          with several maps that mimic the style of id's
                          "Thy Flesh Consumed" and hell-themed levels
                          filling out the rest of the roster.                          

                          Episode 5, "Base Instinct", is a "bonus"
                          episode of E1/E2-style maps, and can be thought
                          of as an alternate take on the Phobos / Deimos
                          story. The episode can be accessed in the main
                          game menu with either ZDoom or Eternity. For
                          vanilla or other ports, running DTWID-E5.wad
                          will load E5's maps in place of E1's.

                          Episode 6, "The Final Gate", is a ZEternity-
                          exclusive "Boss Rush" episode consisting of
                          E*M8 candidates. No separate wad is provided,
                          as MAPINFO is required to make the boss exits
                          work, though the individual maps are vanilla
                          compatible for those willing to put the maps
                          in the correct slots.

Note: Maps prefixed with an asterisk (*) have been modified "in post" to
      some extent for either quality revamp or bugfixing reasons. All
      post-production on these maps was done by Xaser, except for E3M1
      (done by Marcaek), E4M6 (a brand-new map by Marnetmar & Alfonzo
      that's loosely based on a layout originally by General Rainbow
      Bacon), and E3M8 (a new map by Marnetmar replacing his original
      submission, "Nucleo Interno".

      The original versions of these maps can be played by loading
      DTWID-LX.wad, in which they'll replace the "new" ones in their
      respective slots. There are no guarantees of vanilla compatibility
      for the originals, however; some, like E2M8, have overflows, and
      at least one map (E3M4) is lacking an exit. Just be warned.

Note #2: A few maps from previous versions have been cycled out of DTWID-LE
      since they appear in other places, in order to avoid map duplication
      (and because there were a few more maps that resurfaced). The old
      maps along with the releases in which they currently reside are:
