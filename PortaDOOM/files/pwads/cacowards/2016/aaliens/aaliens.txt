Misc. Author Info       : Makes maps for Doom

Description             : Ancient Aliens is a megawad featuring 32 colorful,
                          action-packed maps for Boom compatible ports.
                          
                          Go on a journey to discover the truth about the 
                          enigmatic origins of human civilization... 
                          
                          I'm not saying it was aliens, but... the truth
                          is out there.

===========================================================================

Port Differences        : ZDoom-based ports and Eternity use MAPINFO for
                          episode selection and story screens.
                          
                          Additionally, in Zdoom-based ports and Eternity,
                          ACS is used to play sound effects occasionally.
                          This is way more cool than it sounds.
