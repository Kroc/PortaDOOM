[1] INTRODUCTION
----------------

[1.1 Compatibility]

  Plutonia Revisited is designed to be vanilla compatible so it should run
  virtually, if not, on every port. Plutonia.wad is a definite prerequisite.

[1.2 Resources]
 
   - Additional textures and graphics were made by Thomas van der Velden


[1.3 Midi Music]

   ** You may use these Midi tracks provided that you give credit to the
   composer and the project**

   All other music are from other sources
  (Check map info for more details)

---------
[2] STORY
---------

  After destroying the weird looking face in the end of your last crusade against hell, you sit back and
  relax, gloating over all the steaming carcasses you've produced. You did not know, however, that this
  was just a gambit, a distraction. The demonic forces have posessed the ethereal architects of reality
  and bent them to further warp your world for the past six months.

  You, unaware of this, suddenly see a portal opening. Thinking it was an exit that would inevitably lead
  you home, you jump into it without hesitation. Suddenly, you end up in some kind of cyber-reality, and
  you feel a strong deja vu. Is hell just recycling ideas nowadays? 

  Unfortunately, the gatekeeper decided to move on from his usual thirst for universal domination
  and settled for a personal vendetta against you. Why? Well, you've kicked its arse several times so
  there's no question that it'd like to see you gone. Gatekeeper bound his reality weaving lackeys to
  create your own personalized hell. You grind your teeth as a result of aggravation that you cannot shake,
  like a splinter in one of the small crevices within your body. You can only hope that killing yet another
  flat bastard at the end of this road will mean freedom. But hey, what can you do? The last several times
  has let you down, so what are the chances it will happen again? You think to yourself, 
                                                                            "This time it's personal."


----------------
[3] INSTALLATION
----------------

  Simply either drag drop prcp.wad onto a source port executable (i.e. Zdoom or Prboom).
  Alternatively you can type into the command line:

  " chocolate-doom -iwad plutonia.wad -file prcp.wad "
  
  If you aren't using chocolate-doom, replace chocolate-doom with the name of your source port of choice.

  *Copied from Plutonia2 txt info* Engines without internal DEHACKED support that
   DO support DeHackEd (such as Chocolate Doom or the old PrBoom v2.02) need the
   -deh parameter to load the DeHackEd patch (i.e -deh prcp.deh).

  Engines that do not support DeHackEd (including Doom95, that is included
  in various releases of Final DOOM) can also run the add-on, but without any
  in-game story texts.

                      to be very pleasing! I wanted to achieve a similar

                      I was especially inspired by the music, my favourite DooM track. I hope
                      my map has the same feeling of the original.

Authors comments    : With inspiration from The Omen's layout, Emerald Pools
                      is named for having several nukage pools. Sometimes
                      it is very hard. Expect some real traps! 
                      I'd like to thank Joshy for detailing and PRIMEVAL for the music.
                      
                      Joshy: I offered to clean up and fix up the map for C30N9 as it was
                      kinda behind in terms of aesthetics. It's not the best but I think it's
                      a cute map and certainly offers plutonic nostaglia with it's simplistic
                      design and heavy onslaughts of monsters.

Authors comments    : This map almost mapped itself. I had no real plan in mind when I started mapping,
                      aside from the idea of doing a non-linear map and allowing different paths the
                      player could take while hunting for the keys. It's a small map, but I'm quite

Authors comments    : Was trying to think of a way to change the gameplay a bit rather than
                      merely mancubuses and arachnatrons, so I put two cybers that needs to
                      be killed before the player can move on. Pretty cool, hey? Was aiming
                      to have a similar outdoor kind of theme with moats and whatnot like
                      the original caughtyard map but in the end, I was getting bored with
                      it. Made it an island instead. It was easier to do and not to mention,
                      looks pretty nice too! All worked out well in the end.

                      for underlined the nostalgic atmosphere. I am used of to make in boom format,
                      it's interesting to work with the constraints of Vanilla, I had to learn to

Authors comments    : This is my second map for the project. I made this map as a remake 
                      of original Plutonia map 08. Also, I made the area outside the 
                      castle and the area after blue key's door while considering original 
                      Plutonia map 02. Judging from the tendency of Plutonia's maps, my 
                      first map (Map 16) is a little longer. Therefore, I aimed to make the 
                      same scale as original Plutonia map 08. However, I added many elements 
                      from Plutonia too much, so this map is a little longer after all.
                      I was really annoyed at VPOs and spent many hours to fix them in the
                      huge area after blue key's door. The main cause was that I couldn't 
                      delete some details by compromise easily. In the end, I was overcome
                      by VPOs and deleted something. However, I really like this part.

Authors comments    : Well, I didn't make a map since 2 years before this one. Fortunately
                      Belial and dew gave me some awesome feedback that reminded me how to
                      make a solid gameplay, as well as new elements to think about for my
                      next projects.
                      Basically it's a remake of Plutonia map 12 called "Speed", early versions
                      were more like my map 15 for Plutonia 2 though. Howewer it has evolved
                      into an acrobatic and brutal map just as "Speed" was instead of being
                      a quick "run and gun".

Author's comments   : Large-ish map revolving around a massive spiraling structure set in a rugged bloody	
 		      landscape. Plenty of buildings and interconnected areas, all of which sport a hectic
                      gameplay style. The centerpiece and namesake of this map is shrouded in mystery (hence
                      the name), but is thought to have been designed by a demonically posessed architect to
                      be some sort of demonic shrine. Its corrupt influence has not only attracted demon
                      presence but also decayed the landscape surrounding it, a fact the numerous dead trees
                      and rivers of bloody water are likely to reflect. Rumors exist that the shrine houses a
                      hidden portal to an unknown dimension, but one would have to be a fool to believe such a
                      myth (if it weren't for the slot this map happens to hold, of course). The author also
                      muses that this might just be the realization of the SHiTWADS Spiral Tower remake he's
                      always wanted to do.

                      also slightly harder than original map.
                      I hope you like the map. Have fun !!!

Bugs                : Small HOMs under vanilla doom

Inspiration         : Plutonia Map15 "The Twilight", Plutonia Map04 "Caged"
Authors comments    : I made this map as a remake of original Plutonia map 15.
                      Especially, I was inspired by the start room which is adjacent 
                      to the exit room, the T-junction against the red sky, and areas 
                      filled by chaingunners. At first, I made a long and flat passage
                      to the T-junction, so you could see T-junction in the near the 
                      start area, but this idea was hindered by terrible HOMs under 
                      vanilla doom. As a result, I added two doors and stairs among 
                      the passage. Also, I decided to add some elements of original 
                      Plutonia map 04 which is a little similar to Plutonia map 15.
                      The elements were mainly used in yellow key part, and I made 
                      a trap in the blue key part from the yellow key room in original 
                      map 04. You obtain the blue key and the yellow key and you push 
                      some switches in an area is accessible by these keys. After that, 
                      a large area appears in the front of the T-junction like original 
                      map 15. What do you encounter in the area? Play it yourself!

                      PRIMEVAL, he did a remix of "Waltz of the Demons" for this map.

                      thanks goes to Belial for that, for he really helped me making this
                      map a vanilla map. Maybe I'll release the original map seperately
                      someday, you'd be suprised by the differences. Still, I'm happy with
                      the end result released here, and I think it's a good "Slayer" tribute,

                      looked a lot like the end area but I changed it around due to chocolate
                      doom's limitation of visplanes; but I'm glad I changed it now cause both

			My first doom2.exe-compatible map. Probably the last one
			also, unless I make something for Whoo's TNT 2, don't know
			yet.
			There's one cool thing about making vanilla maps : at
			least you don't spend hours on detailing. But otherwise
			I'm not a big fan of working under such limitations,
			resource and engine-wise.

			The overall design was much more open during the beta 
			stages, but sadly I had to create and enlarge those rocky

			"Necrogenesis" is actually a nod to both Plutonia map

                      This map was kinda a pain to map as my mapping methods are not
                      so vanilla-doom friendly with VPOs coming in at various areas. Many

Inspiration         : Thinking back, it was mostly free-form and experimenting with Plutonia textures,

Authors comments    : Besides rambling on about how long I left this sitting before getting back to
                      it as the project finishes up, I don't really have much to say. It's definitely
                      the best and possibly only map I've done in the plutonia style, and working
                      within the limitations of vanilla I'd have to say one of the most constricting
                      maps I've made. Not easy to limit yourself to 130 or so viewable sidedefs,
                      though I made it simple enough to never worry about VPOs. But the points isn't
                      to complain about self-imposed maplimits, it's on playing the game. So have a go
                      at the map - and since you're reading this, try getting the arch-vile to launch
                      you out the window. A nice little surprise awaits ;)

Authors comments    : I enjoy playing non-linear maps, so from the get-go that's what I set out to
                      make. While I have played through Plutonia many times, I wasn't exactly
                      familiar with that style of maps it's made up of. All I could go on was what
                      I remembered from playing it. I think I nailed the look and feel of a
                      Plutonia map pretty good. The difficulty is up there as well and it all comes
                      to a hectic conclusion at the end of the map. Seeing as it's in the MAP29 slot,
                      I hope the difficulty is appropriate enough for the second to last map. My aim
                      was to have that same feeling of playing through the original Plutonia but with
                      flow that's more akin to my own style than that of the Iwad. I hope you guys enjoy
                      playing it! And I would like to thank dew for his excellent advice on gameplay as well.

Authors comments    : My original idea was to have 7+ cyberdemons, but that was becoming way too hard for every

                      the count starts to jump high(Around 7.) I expect the ammo/health count to be controversial,
                      since I always got mixed opinions from testers about it. Hopefully this map won't be too
                      cramped for cooperative, and I'm also hoping that it will be decent for deathmatch.

			Hell Revealed II map 32
Author's comments   : Plutonia's "Go 2 It" was the first slaughtermap I played.
			At that time, when Hell Revealed didn't exist and
			when I was still playing with a keyboard, Go 2 It
			was an impressive monster of a map to me.
			"For expert marines only", heh.

			Thus, I think it's an honor to be given a chance to
			create a Go 2 It sequel. Nobody had claimed the 32th
			slot of Plutonia Revisited so far, so it was
			a good opportunity for me to seize.

			Hopefully Have @ It will be as hard now as Go 2 It was back
			in the day.

			Fun facts : the map was called "Go 4 It As Well" before
			I was given new suggestions by the Doomworld community.
			The map was then supposed to be called "Go 8 It", but
			in the end Xaser convinced me to use Primeval's suggestion,
			"Have @ It".

			The map's layout went under major changes after I
			realized VPOs couldn't be avoided. There was supposed to
			be some huge cave behind the lowered Mancubi wall, and
			quite a big fight there with an army of Hell Knights and
			some Cyberdemons popping-up behind them if you went too far.
			I had to remove this part.
			Moreover, at first I only planned to mix parts from 
			Doom II map 01 and TNT map 01, but when the map was 
			halfway-done, K!r4 ( co-author of "Go 4 It" ) told me it 
			would be nice to have pieces of E1M1 in there, so that 
			every Go 2 It sequel could somehow add elements from 
			new maps while keeping references to maps already included
			in previous iterations.
			I liked his idea and redrew the ending part to 
			include a section from E1M1. Thanks K!r4 ;)

			Anyway, enough with words, now Go Play It !

  There are inevitable HOMs and possibly VPO's we might've overlooked. VPO can occur with noclip running
  on chocolate-doom.

  Otherwise, we hope it's clean as a whistle! :-)
