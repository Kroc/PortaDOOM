Description             : Welcome, all, to the eleventh iteration of
                          32in24, brought to you by YEDS!  This time,
                          we've gone for 8-player free-for-all, but with a
                          twist!  After finishing our levels, we spent a
                          full week on playtesting, including a full
                          session on Odamex Nitro!  We hope that this
                          rigorous testing process has resulted in a
                          strong, memorable collection of levels for you to
                          play!  You owe it to yourself to stick it to the

Additional Credits to   : dew for his immense amount of effort and time
                          spent on ensuring the balance of this WAD is
                          absolutely PERFECT.
                          The Green Herring for compilation and all the
                          small bits of polish that make this shine.
                          Shaikoten for project lead and not opening Doom
                          Builder once but managing to keep everyone on
                          task and on time.
                          essel for co-leading and generally being awesome.
                          Ralphis for his critiques and getting us hooked
                          up with Odamex Nitro. But also for breaking our
                          Nitro servers with the new release :|
                          Odamex Nitro crew including HumanBones and Hex.
                          CC4 crew for the texture wad.
                          All the MIDI composers whose music we ganked.
                          Xaser for the HELP graphic.
                          deathz0r for absolutely nothing, yet again.
                          Carn for being the butt of bad jokes even though
                          he's not really fat or much of a bad guy.

Why we did it this way  : So most 32in24s just plop out all the maps in one
                          day and we play them like that. That or the
                          layouts are done in a day and we spend like a
                          month detailing them. And I (shaikoten) was
                          getting a little sick of having some inconsistent
                          quality. Sure we produced a lot of great maps,
                          but on the other hand there were a lot of turds.
                          The approach we took to this 32in24 was to, as
                          usual, make the 32 maps in 24 hours (45 in this
                          case,) and then spend a week not on detailing,
                          but on playtesting to make sure that everything
                          played great. It turns out a lot of those maps
                          that started out as turds were salvaged by this
                          simple process and turned into really fun, and
                          highly refined maps, still made in a much shorter
                          time than the majority of Doom projects of this
                          quality. I'm extremely proud of this release, and
                          I hope the competitive doomers out there, or the
                          hardcore FFA players, can find a set of great
                          maps to latch onto.
