Description             : The third and final part of my solo megawad.
                          Part 3 of 'Jenesis' adds 12 extra maps to the
                          first twenty (which have all also been modified
                          for the better in some way or another) and
                          replaces the final map, as its predecessor did.

                          'Jenesis' is a 32-level megawad for Boom,
                          complete with a new final boss, a new monster,
                          new status bar graphics and a recolored message
                          font.

                          The aim of this project was mainly to hone my
                          skills in traditional Doom level design, but it
                          was also to create a presentable set of maps
                          which pulled inspiration from the great megawads
                          like the Memento Mori duology, Hell Revealed,
                          Alien Vendetta, Requiem and Scythe. These are
                          just some of the mapsets out there that Jenesis
                          pays homage to, thematically.

                          This is the megawad's final release. In total it
                          has taken about one year and one month of hard
                          mapping, bugtesting and procrastination to
                          complete. :P

Additional Credits to   : - My beta testers, Mechadon, MegaDoomer,
			  hawkwind, [WH]-Wilou84 and Anima Zero.
                          - My brother Ben (aka "Baratus") and cousin Paul
                          who also beta-tested. :)
                          - Many musicians whose work I've used in this
                          project, and whom I've credited below.
                          - TheCupboard and worst-vd-plas, for the modified
                          zombie marine monster from their WAD, The Great
                          Bicycle Mystery 2. I stole the DEHACKED code, but
                          I think they were okay with that. :P
                          - All those mentioned on the CREDIT screen (they
                          aren't listed in any particular order, BTW).
                          - Mechadon for providing incredibly useful
                          feedback on each release of this mapset from the
                          very beginning, and recording demos which were
                          awesome too. He also did the DEHACKED work for
                          the SUPER SPECIAL NEW BOSS.
                          - hawkwind, who helped me out tremendously with
                          the very technical assistance he provided. He
                          also made edits to the maps where appropriate.
                          [Unfortunately the changes he made to the
                          starting room of MAP18 presented problems in the
                          source ports I tested them in. I simplified the
                          area in the end, because the room would simply
                          not work properly no matter how much he and I 
                          changed it. This did unfortunately mean reworking
                          many of his changes. Sorry, buddy - it's nothing
                          personal. All your help was immensely appreciated
                          so thanks a load. :D]
                          - MegaDoomer for his frequent and detailed
                          feedback and reports. Thanks a lot, man. :)
                          - VortexCortex, for providing insightful feedback
                          where he could, and migrating my and Mechadon's
                          private discussion board's posts to a new forum.
                          Your genius astounds me, good sir. :P

===========================================================================
* Level List *

MAP01  -  Treatment Plant
  : Music - "Into the Fire" by Nick "Theshooter7" George / 'War and Glory'
  : Par Time - 2:00
  : Build Time - 10 hours (?)
  
  : A huge refining and storage facility on the surface of Phobos. This is
    where you have been dispatched to take out the initial hordes of
    demons. Uses Doom 1's E1 sky (naturally).

MAP02  -  The Canal
  : Music - "River" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 2:30
  : Build Time - 8 hours

  : An infested reservoir branching off the treatment plant, fallen into
    disuse and decay. Lots of rock, slime and water in this map. Uses
    Memento Mori 1's E1 sky.

MAP03  -  The Oasis Facility
  : Music - "Under the Waves" by James "Jimmy" Paddock / 'Pendulum'
  : Par Time - 2:20
  : Build Time - 12 hours
  
  : A kind of purification plant set in a watery outset on Phobos, which
    unfortunately allows demon life to flourish. Uses TNT's E1 sky.

MAP04  -  The Garden Terminal II
  : Music - "CCCool" by Lee Jackson
  : Par Time - 2:30
  : Build Time - This was started back when I used DeePsea. Years ago. :O
  
  : In many ways a slightly redone and expanded version of the original 
    Hell Revealed map, which still remains one of my favorite maps from the
    WAD. Uses the HR E1 sky, presumably by either Yonatan Donner or Haggay
    Niv.

MAP05  -  Submerged Refinery
  : Music - "Rusty Bridge" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 1:40
  : Build Time - 8 hours (?)
  
  : A UAC waste disposal outpost fallen into disuse, so excessive pools
    of toxic waste are abundant, and there are few radsuits to be found.
    Inspired mostly by Plutonia E2, partially by Simplicity, and partially
    by Doom E1. Uses the gray/green sky found in Skulltag and Simplicity.

MAP06  -  Waystation
  : Music - "Pistons" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 1:30
  : Build Time - 10 hours (?)
  
  : A control point in the middle of Phobos's poisoned ocean. It's a small
    outpost but the monsters are many - indeed, quite a few of them fly,
    allowing them to get the drop on you, pretty much no matter where you
    hide. Uses Doom 1's E1 sky.

MAP07  -  Dead Center
  : Music - "World Tournament II" by Jay "Zora" Reichard
  : Par Time - 3:00
  : Build Time - 2 hours
  
  : A small, evacuated storage facility set, ostensibly, in the middle
    of nowhere. Since evacuation took place, hellspawn have set up a
    seemingly permanent home inside and around it, and they'll throw
    everything they've got at you in their bid to defend it. Uses
    textures from Enjay's fantastic Marine Assault wad, and the Doom 2
    E1 sky.

MAP08  -  Plunge
  : Music - "Sewer Chase" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 1:40
  : Build Time - 8 hours

  : A sewer network far beneath the surface of the moon. Twisting
    corridors and vast rocky arenas filled with pools of toxic slime
    characterize this map. No sky.

MAP09  -  Slime Vaults
  : Music - "Undisclosed Desires" by James "Jimmy" Paddock / 'Muse'
  : Par Time - 3:15
  : Build Time - Freakin' ages

  : You travel even further deep into the moon, where a large toxin
    refinery resides. Looks like it'll be a little easy to get lost if
    you're not on the ball. Uses Scientist 2 E2 sky.

MAP10  -  Ruins
  : Music - "Garden" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 2:25
  : Build Time - Freakin' ages

  : Having escaped the underground slime caverns, you find yourself in
    a decimated village. Who knows what happened here, but right now
    you've got to get back on track and find a path to the UAC gateway.
    Uses Scientist 2 E2 sky.

MAP11  -  Devil's Industry
  : Music - "Crush" by James "Jimmy" Paddock / 'Pendulum'
  : Par Time - 2:45
  : Build Time - 4 days

  : A large, highly non-linear power plant on Deimos, crawling with
    hellspawn and full of mechanical hazards that have been subverted by
    the demons. Uses the foggy sky from Hexen.

MAP12  -  Highway of Destruction
  : Music - "Liar" by Yngwie Malmsteen
  : Par Time - 1:20
  : Build Time - 5 hours (?)

  : A tarnished highway plagued with hellspawn. Completely linear, but
    highly hectic gameplay. Uses Memento Mori 1's E3 sky.

MAP13  -  Transporter Station
  : Music - "Zerpentine" by Bobby Prince
  : Par Time - 2:30
  : Build Time - 2 days

  : A large teleport research complex which is in the process of being
    overrun and razed by the demons. Uses Scythe 2's E1 sky.

MAP14  -  Poisoned Ocean
  : Music - "Pathogen" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 1:45
  : Build Time - 8 hours
  
  : Takes place at an outpost set in the midst of a Martian sea polluted
    by all manner of foul chemicals. This once habitable locale is now a
    breeding ground for demons. Expect tricks and traps aplenty. Somewhat
    inspired by Alien Vendetta's middle episode, and Plutonia. Uses Doom
    1's E4 sky.

MAP15  -  Alchemy
  : Music - "Voyage I (Edit)" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 2:40
  : Build Time - 3 days (?)

  : A massive extraction facility set on a large liquid gold mine. Full
    of hazards, particularly due to the molten gold stored liberally
    throughout the facility. Uses Doom 1's E4 sky.

MAP16  -  Crestfallen
  : Music - "Cliff" (Edit) by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 2:45
  : Build Time - 2 days

  : A generator complex. What it's generating is unclear, but you have to
    get through it in order to reach the path to the overtaken gateway.

MAP17  -  Deadline
  : Music - "Prototype" by James Paddock and Stuart Rynn (collaboration)
  : Par Time - 2:10
  : Build Time - 12 hours

  : Back underground again - and it's a defective tram network underneath
    the generator complex. Because it's totally out of order, it looks
    like you'll have to take a largely non-linear route to the exit.
    No sky.

MAP18  -  Mineshaft
  : Music - "Airport Chant" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 3:20
  : Build Time - 2 days

  : Further underground, but not far from the gateway now. Fight your way
    through these weaving mines but be prepared for some hazardous terrain.
    No sky.

MAP19  -  Subterranean Labs
  : Music - "In Space" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 1:50
  : Build Time - 1 day

  : This infested underground laboratory is crawling with monsters, and the
    lava-filled caverns will certainly not help your escape. No sky.

MAP20  -  Into The Gate
  : Music - "Duke's Domain" by Jenna Ramsey
  : Par Time - 2:40
  : Build Time - 12 hours
  
  : A big gateway control complex on Deimos, positively overrun by
    demon swarms. Expect a lot of resistance. The gateway technicians
    have been possessed by demons, and they appear as a new enemy. Very
    much inspired by E2 and Plutonia's MAP23. Uses Doom 1's E2 sky.

MAP21  -  The Other Side
  : Music - "Deevine" by Xaser Acheron
  : Par Time - 0:40
  : Build Time - 6 hours

  : A very small Scythe 2-inspired map, serving as the introduction to the
    Hell episode. Mud and blood everywhere. Uses Doom 1's E4 sky.

MAP22  -  Haunted Halls
  : Music - "Bassline" by Mark Klem
  : Par Time - 2:25
  : Build Time - 1 day

  : A ghostly marble and brick fortress inhabited by some pretty strong
    hellspawn - hope you're well-prepared. Uses a custom sky by Mechadon.

MAP23  -  The Atrium
  : Music - "Distant Tranquility" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 2:40
  : Build Time - 3 hours (plus all fixes)
  
  : A hellish stone castle on the outskirts of hell, surrounded by a
    huge moat of molten lava and guarded by a veritable army of
    hellspawn. Dark corridors, treacherous walkways and trap after
    trap await. Uses Doom 1's E2 sky.

MAP24  -  Hades' Wall
  : Music - "Sunset Over Babylon" by James "Jimmy" Paddock
  : Par Time - 3:30
  : Build Time - 3 days

  : A rocky canyon bordered by a large Hellkeep. Once again, large moats of
    lava are abound, and hellspawn stalk every nook and cranny of the area.
    Uses ravagefox's Doom 1 E3/E4 sky combo.

MAP25  -  The Carcass Pit
  : Music - "Going Nowhere" by Revenant
  : Par Time - 1:20
  : Build Time - 1.5 days

  : You're not out of the rocky peaks yet - you'll have to brave a huge
    slaughtering ground first. Here's where things start to get pretty
    hectic. Uses Memento Mori's E2 sky.

MAP26  -  The Savage Abyss
  : Music - "Song in the Key of TNT" by Jamie Robertson
  : Par Time - 4:30
  : Build Time - 14 hours STRAIGHT
  
  : A great yawning chasm set in the center of Hell itself, the
    surroundings of which are caked in lava, fire, marble, and infested
    with hellspawn. This is the boss map, as it were - it's
    unquestionably the hardest (and largest) map in the whole set.
    Uses a modified (and hopefully -improved-) version of TNT's E2 sky.

MAP27  -  The Vulcanum
  : Music - "Fallen" by Simone Mularoni / 'Symphony X'
  : Par Time - 3:30
  : Build Time - TOO LONG

  : A massive hellish gauntlet - a bathing hole for demons. This map has
    slaughterfest written all over it (mainly because it's Scythe-inspired)
    and very little ground is available, so you'd better be careful.

MAP28  -  Baphomet's Keep
  : Music - "The Greater Good" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 3:50
  : Build Time - A few days

  : This looks like where Baphomet and the worst of his legions are hiding.
    Storm the castle and kill that bastard for all time! Uses Plutonia's E2
    sky.

MAP29  -  Mutant Jenesis
  : Music - "Moonlight Bloodbath" by Henri "Icytux" Vuortenvirta
  : Par Time - 3:00
  : Build Time - Way too long
  
  : With Baphomet destroyed, you are catapulted back to Phobos.
    Unfortunately your return is not a welcome one. Uses Scythe 2's E1 sky.

MAP30  -  Abysm
  : Music - "doombg" by ynxyg
  : Par Time - 3:20
  : Build Time - ???
  
  : Good luck, marine. You'll need it here.

----- ( SECRET LEVELS ) -----

MAP31  -  Duality
  : Music - "Smells like Burning Corpse (Remix)" by Jay "Zora" Reichard
  : Par Time - 4:25
  : Build Time - 2 days
  
  : A hellish peak guarded by a terrible monstrosity that as yet, remains
    undescribed. Best of luck with this ordeal.

MAP32  -  Reprise
  : Music - "River" by Stuart "Forty-Two" Rynn
  : Par Time - 4:10
  : Build Time - Quite a few days, but this was done several years ago
  
  : The strangest feeling of deja-vu sweeps over you...

Thanks to everyone on Doomworld who helped make this megawad possible.
You guys rock. :D

This megawad was released on 28 November 2011, the final day I spent
living in the UK before my family emmigrated to Australia. It's been a
good twenty years, old friend. Australia, bring it on.
