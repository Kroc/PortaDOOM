Description             : A preview of the Vaporware map pack for The
                          Eternity Engine, containing the project's first
                          map, "Cargo Transfer" by Esselfortium.
                          
                             MAP01: Cargo Transfer

                          This map is actually part 1 of an in-development
                          mini-episode that makes up part of Vaporware.

                          The full Vaporware project is in glacially-paced
                          development by a team including AgentSpork,
                          Vader, Esselfortium, Tango, 5hfifty, Kristus,
                          Mechadon, Brinks, and SoM.

Known Bugs              : Vaporware depends on some functionality that is
                          not yet fully implemented. The map is tested and
                          completely playable, but you may run into a few
                          oddities, such as:
                          
                          * When crossing portal boundaries, it is
                            sometimes possible to telefrag monsters that
                            stand in your way.

                          * Hitscan weapons cannot currently be fired
                            through portals. If you're seeing your bullets
                            disappear or hit an invisible wall, try taking
                            a few steps forward.

                          * A small blip is sometimes noticeable when
                            riding up a lift through a portal boundary.
