Description             : Everybody knows that most maps from 1994 are pretty
                          terrible, but what if we took maps from the archive
                          that permit modification and then redetailed them?

                          The purpose of this community wad is to improve on
                          maps from 1994. Most maps from that time had strong
                          layouts, but poor design decisions such as misaligned
                          textures, bad texture choices, hidden doors and
                          mandatory secrets to progress. The aim of this
                          project is to fix those problems and take what was
                          already strong about the original maps and improve it.
