Description		: MINOS' JUDGEMENT is the 4th Canto in my INFERNO 
			  series.  In your search for Beatrice, your
			  guide, Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) has just
			  successfully lead you through the First Circle of
			  Hades -- only to bring you to the court of Minos,
			  the Judge of Hell.  
			    "Well," you say, "this is another fine mess
			  you've gotten us into.  Now what?"
			    Virgil, with his usual loquacity, replies:
			  "Heh heh."

			  This is a very large level; good luck.

			  And pay attention to the lighting detail: it took
			  me hours.
