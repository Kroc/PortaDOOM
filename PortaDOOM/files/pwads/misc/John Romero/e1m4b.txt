General Description     : Tom Hall originally created the framework for E1M4.
						  It makes sense that if I was creating an entire E1 of
						  just my work, this would be the level I would remake.

To Run This WAD			: The easiest way is to download ZDOOM from ZDOOM.ORG. You can 
						  drag the WAD file onto the EXE (or APP), then warp to the
						  level by typing IDCLEV14 when you're in the game.

With the Toxin Refinery in the rear-view, you make your way to Phobos Mission Control
where the computers crunching the data from the Phobos Anomaly are located. You need 
to use them to gain access to the Phobos Lab, but remember hearing that the computers 
were tied into all areas of the installation and that you never knew when the environment
around you would change. You need to keep your eyes alert to all movement - this
place is not what it seems...
