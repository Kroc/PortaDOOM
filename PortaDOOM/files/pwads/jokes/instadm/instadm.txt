Misc. Author Info       : Does Doom stuff

Description             : If you just can't get enough of taking pictures
                          of your food and making it look more magenta,
                          InstaDoom is for you! Play Doom with any of the
                          40(!) official Instagram filters! Memento Mori
                          with Mayfair! Requiem with Rise! Icarus with
                          Inkwell! Alien Vendetta with Aden or Valencia!
                          
                          ALSO INCLUDES: Selfie Doom: Buddy Adding Edition!
                          Indulge your narcissistic urges even in the deepest
                          corners of Hell! With the new multiplayer
                          compatibility, take group selfies in front of famous
                          landmarks! As seen in Le Monde!
                          
                          Note that in any non-ZDoom-based port, the Selfie
                          Stick replaces the BFG, and all chainsaw and BFG
                          item placements are swapped, so you can pick up the
                          Selfie Stick on Map01 ASAP. (Since the Doomguy
                          doesn't have to worry about lugging around the BFG,
                          he can also carry 50% more plasma ammo.) In
                          ZDoom-based ports, the Selfie Stick is a special
                          extra DECORATE weapon bound to the 7 key.
						  
                          ALSO ALSO INCLUDES: InstaDoom DLC Pack 1! Is
                          Instagram too "mainstream" for your tastes? Do you
                          need filters -- er, I mean, "presets" -- that
                          really scream, "I am a hipster"? Do you not care
                          about usability? Then you'll love the new VSCO Cam
                          DLC pack!
                          
                          17 new filters (er, I mean, "presets") that
                          emulate each of the currently-free filt- uh,
                          presets in the VSCO Cam app! Most of them look
                          like garbage, but they are painfully hip! Sneer
                          at the basic bitches on Instagram with such
                          purposely-obtusely-named presets as A4, B5, M3,
                          and the ever-popular P5!!
