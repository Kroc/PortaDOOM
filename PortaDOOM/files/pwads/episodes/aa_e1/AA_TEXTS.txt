Yes, this is it, baby, a rusty planet. Everything here is about rust. Equipement must be older than anyone
maintaining it, communications are all rotten down, anything barely works here. You and your squad 
seem stuck in this hole for sure... but not for long. A distress call recieved from Phobos an hour ago
requests all help which could be provided. Guys happily ran to the armory, prepairing for some fun.
-"Probably a bunch of some pirate scum lurking around". 
-"Yeah, just another baby sitting job".

But you have better things to do here hunting down some corporate rats in the offices...


=================================
E1M1: Surface Exit #08, Airlock B
=================================

2 hours passed since your team's dispatch on Phobos. Transmitter is still silent, no feedback. After
loosing another bunch of credits in a card game you take your gun and decide it's better to go out or
else someone becomes really sharp here.

Walking thru old installation you see various crap around: open panels, wires and rusty pipes all around,
exposed circuits, half-dead broken computers and machinery. Upon entering security room you see 
two guards steering at monitor. 
-"There's someone lying near airlock exit, anyone wants to check?". No one volunteers, meaning you
will have to go there.

The last gate opens and you prepare to step outside then suddenly... a barrier falls down right in front 
of your nose. -"Nice joke, now let me out!". Instead, you hear noise, screams and gunfire. Then, the
channel just goes silent...


========================================
E1M2: North Maintenance Tunnel, Branch 3
========================================

After miles of silence in this underground you finally start getting back in action. Screams and gunfire
can heard in the distance. Seems that portions of main tunnel have been sealed off, making your 
progression here a little bit harder.

Anyway, what a hell is going on? Where are those monsters coming from? Are toxic mutagens from 
nearby plant causing this? And what about people getting insane and shooting at YOU instead of those 
creeps? Bad air, probably.. Or a virus of some sort from medlabs...


===============================
E1M3: Nukage Distillation Plant
===============================

Green gold... That's how corporate executives call it. This liquid serves many purposes on Mars: fuel, 
electrolysis, smelting, fusion, biowasting, pharmacy, food production. The unfortunate side effects are 
planets pollution, erosion, health problems, monopolization of markets by companies that control it's 
production... And, in the end, all those mutants you've encountered today. So, you have no choice but 
to clean up this place.


========================================
E1M4: Infirmary and Medical Laboratories
========================================

Lift door opens, immediately revealing sterile shine of silver paneling. In one place there is infirmary, 
rehabilitation, reception.. as well as some science and medical experimental labs. Eggheads sure have 
a lot of victims here to toy with - those who agreed for extra few credits or were forced to cooperate 
(as a cost cutting measure). Rumors tell they're conducting experiments also with teleportation of 
organic matter, so this must be the cause. It's time to suspend all scientific programs here and terminate 
all unsuccessful results...


================================
E1M5: Nukage Accumulation Domain
================================

Always nice to step on a solid ground after journey thru biowaste channels, especially when your 
protective suit is ready to meltdown completely. Since you are surrounded by green liquid this must be 
the nukage accumulator. Well, data from medlabs shows that the eggheads have only studied those 
creeps, so their origin remains to be under question.

Control room is located inside the dome, from there an access to waste dump facility and storage area 
can be granted, this is the only way out except to be wasted again...


=================================
E1M6: Dump Facility and Logistics
=================================

Well, back into the dark underground tunnel. Being the oldest complex on Mars, once it had a transport 
pad, science labs, administration offices. Now it's reduced to be simply a toxin dump and a cargo bay. 
Some sections are under "self decommission" process or, simply, flooded in nukage.

Mapper already intensely shows some strange objects in crate yard, placed in pentagon.

Access key should be somewhere there also, apparently, in a control tower.

Outside area is rumored to be haunted by those creeps, they are all over the canyon. Also, those dump
drainages exiting there could lead you somewhere close to waste gate. Nearby there is a tunnel to 
the north from complex, leading to Colony A3. Rest of marines may be waiting for you there.


=========================
E1M7: Mars Colony Alpha 3
=========================

You've woken up in this cellblock with a strong headache, trying to remember how and when did you 
get here. There is none of your gear anywhere around, except (thank god!) your trusty 15mm and 
message tracker. Flashbacks show a horrible endless gut.. Then, some marines carrying you thru
streets of colony A3. You remember seeing strange buildings around, more like antique...
Terminal data tells there's a terraformation site under the colony and all reports about attacks
point in that direction...

There is noise outside, screams, gunfire. The exit seems to be blocked. You step onto the balcony 
and... what the HELL!! You see FIRE all around, beyond SEA OF BLOOD, walls incrusted with 
SKULLS, impaled VICTIMS moaning!!!

You rush in the room trying to put your jaw back in place, then suddenly someone starts to break in! 
If you don't act fast, this place becomes your coffin. Well, there is a backdoor...


========================
E1M8: Site 9 Terraformer
========================

The lift finally stops and old rusty gate opens. Stepping out, you feel that something's wrong - 
it's really warm here for a murky dark cave. You hear a splashing water nearby and some heavy 
machinery sounds echoing from the depths of this underworld. A terraforming outpost is located 
somewhere on first cave level.

Some highly ranked UAC mobs were conducting occult shenanigans, with sacrifices and bloodlust. 
After today's adventure it's hard not to believe there're something in it. According to data from 
colony files the source of all the that mess should be here.

Lower cave levels have been sealed off. Rumors told about ancient ruins found deep underground. 
Would be nice to check them...


===========================
E1M9: Site 5 Mining complex
===========================

Waste channel led you outside in a choky canyon. In the distance a lift installation can be seen, 
probably leading to one of those old mining shafts. There might be some useful mining tools you 
could borrow. Below are mine tunnels, unstable undergrond caves, vent and lift installations. 
And a lot of those bastards waiting for your bullets...
