Description             : I always wanted to make something classic but with 
			  a new content. This wad has not only new maps, 
			  textures and music but also new things.
			  Also there are new monsters (boss included), 
			  and a new (barely) map hazard - voltage...
			  Maps in this episode are quite large and more of an 
			  andventure sort than anything else, but there's
			  enough monsters to shoot at.

			  I hope this will not end being a cliffhanger, because
			  there are lot of things saved for later episodes which
			  I'd like to implement.

* Story so far *

Set on Mars during horrific events on it's moons another marine is stranded
on old terraformation base, suddenly under attack by unknown force. During his 
journey he learns that there's something more serious going on than just UAC's 
genetic experiments...


===========================================================================


* Instructions *

Zip archive should have those files:
AA_E1.wad - all maps and resources (sprites, textures, graphics, dehacked)
AA_E1.deh - Dehacked patch with new monsters, objects, texts
AA_E1.exe - DooM+ executable patched with AA_E1.deh
AA_TEXTS.txt - intermission texts, credits
AA_E1.txt - this file
AA.bat - don't touch it
AA_dosbox.bat - Run it to play in dosbox (specify paths to dosbox and doom 
		folders) 

--------------------------------------------------
Warning!!! This wad Works only with Ultimate DooM!
--------------------------------------------------

Jumping, crouching, looking up/down is prohibited.

This wad may be considered quasi-vanilla - it doesn't need a sourceport to
be played because AA_E1.exe is provided (so, only DooM.wad is needed).
AA_E1.exe has increased static limits (because some maps are too large and
can cause visplane or savegame errors), so a limit-removing port should be used.

Most of new objects are interactive.

Voltage sometimes has a little secret about it.

This time a boss fight isn't just your average baron beating.
