Description             : Doomed Space Wars is a Star Wars-inspired mapset
                          but with mostly Doom enemies and weapons. There are
                          9 levels divided into 3x 3 level mini episodes and
                          3 secret levels. At the end of each 3 level mini
                          episode there is a boss. Every map is huge and
                          takes advantages of Zdoom's special features such
                          as 3D floors and reverb. Also there are tons of
                          secrets and a few top secret Easter eggs. The aim
                          for the level design was realism and a dark
                          atmosphere, with huge height variations and a semi
                          linear overlapping progression. I focused hard on
                          lighting and architecture to create a super
                          realistic environment to go with challenging gameplay
			  but there are no slaughtermaps, sorry guys. Also
			  included are 10 exclusive Deathmatch levels.
                          
                          Also in addition are 9 new monsters thanks to
                          Zdoom's DECORATE feature and also I cannot forget
                          the totally original orchestral soundtrack composed
                          by me with the songs in .mp3 format.

Notes			: Please read the Space Wars Readme text file for more
