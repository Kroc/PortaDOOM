3. GENERAL INFORMATION
----------------------

NEW ENEMIES:

   In addition to the familiar foes you will encounter are some new beasts.

 - DARK TROOPER (140 hp)
   You thought the Chaingunner was a pain in the butt. Just wait until you meet the Dark Trooper. He'll
   make your life a living hell! ... These are the dead security guards on board the space station that 
   were resurrected by the hellspawn. Luckily they are only found in the green zone.

 - SECURITY DROID (150 hp)
   Another resurrected enemy on the Space Station. These floating mechanical squids move quickly and
   fire an extremely fast and painful ball of plasma. They can ambush you in unexpected ways as you
   journey throughout the vast space station. Quick timing and wits are required to down them.
   
 - TORTURED SOUL (400 hp)
   This floating Pain Elemental pretty much acts like his cousin. But instead of spitting lost souls
   he lets out dense, suffocating clouds of contaminated Chlorine which will cause extreme pain to
   every living soul nearby. Not even a Radiation Suit would save you.

 - SITH HELL KNIGHT (750 hp)
   The Hell Knight's tougher cousin. He is just like the Hell Knight and Baron of Hell, but his health
   is in-between the Hell Knight and Baron of Hell. He is grey in colour.

 - DARKSIDE CACODEMON (800 hp)
   This super fast, hard to see navy blue transparent Cacodemon will give you nightmares forever!

 - GIANT CACODEMON (800 hp)
   This huge Cacodemon is rarely seen. But when you kill it, 4 normal Cacodemons are born to assure
   your ammo is getting plenty of usage.

 - HECTEBUS (1,500hp)
   You thought fatso was bad? .... Just wait until you meet his cousin the Hectebus. He is harder to kill
   and his powerful green fireballs inflict serious damage. Even a Cyberdemon often struggles against a
   pair of these very well camouflaged beasts.

 - AFRIT (2,000 hp)
   This floating legless Baron of Hell has a variety of attacks and can devastate your plans if you 
   are not careful. He is also very hard to kill.
 
 - CHAOS ELEMENTAL (6,000 hp)
   Awaiting for you at the very end of your journey is this mighty floating beast. He is super fast, shoots
   fireballs that can cause extreme damage and can even occasionally shoot Lost Souls at you. And he is not
   alone, he also has help with all the other floating terrors. Also he is well camouflaged, a true nightmare
   indeed. In order to prevail you need to be well loaded and have strong wits.
