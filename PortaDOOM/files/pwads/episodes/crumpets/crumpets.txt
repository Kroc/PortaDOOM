Description             : Crumpets is a set of 9 bite-size boom-compatible
                          maps, designed to be played from pistol start. The
                          levels are small, typically 50-100 monsters a
                          piece, and loosely follow a plutonia / marble-ruins
                          aesthetic. UV is designed for experts, so I
                          encourage most players to start off on HMP.

===========================================================================
                                MAP LIST:
===========================================================================


==================
MAP01: "Earl Grey"
==================
Build Time:    1.5 hr
Midi:          "Chains of Ocean and Flame" - Xenogears

I think someone put something in my drink...


================
MAP02: "Flutter"
================
Build Time:    5.0 hr
Midi:          "Dragon Roost Island" - Zelda: Wind Waker

Cute little opening map. Easy fights, nothing special.


=================
MAP03: "Tiramisu"
=================
Build Time:    4.5 hr
Midi:          "Home Sweet Home" - The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall

Tiny map that can be deceptively tough on UV.


===============
MAP04: "Bocuma"
===============
Build Time:    3.5 hr
Midi:          "Character Making" - Final Fantasy Tactics

First level I made for the set. I originally was just scribbling around 
trying to hash out texture themes that would eventually become Sunlust 
map14, but I decided it would be fun to sharpen the old speedmapping claws. 
Thus "Crumpets" was born, a way for me to entertain myself with some 
relaxing mapping in between the development of maps for other projects.


=======================
MAP05: "Mint Chocolate"
=======================
Build Time:    6.5 hr
Midi:          "Subterra" - Original composition by Ribbiks

Super compact little map. A few tough fights on UV, a glimpse of what's to 
come. Several aesthetics were inspired by map24 of CChest2, as was the midi
I made for the level.


===================
MAP06: "Masquerade"
===================
Build Time:    4.5 hr
Midi:          "Stage 4" - Alien Vs. Predator (SNES)

A tight, slightly awkward layout with predominantly claustrobic fights. I 
really like this progression in this map, though I understand that many
players will probably dislike it for being so cramped.


======================
MAP07: "Frog And Toad"
======================
Build Time:    8.0 hr
Midi:          "Trisection" - Final Fantasy Tactics

A layout that was originally drawn up during a speedmapping session of some 
sort (one of the Tango TV ones maybe?). I didn't complete it in the alotted 
time so I put it on the backburner and eventually polished it up for this 
set. Hard as nails! You can finish it super-quick with a ballsy rush on the 
YK, but there's plenty of neat optional content as well.


==============
MAP08: "Shamu"
==============
Build Time:    6.0 hr
Midi:          "Egypt" - Original composition by Ribbiks

Delicious curves! This one ended up being more spacious than I anticipated. 
The enemy composition and darkened visuals introduce an oppressive 
atmosphere to the mapset.


====================
MAP09: "Crackerjack"
====================
Build Time:    12.0 hr
Midi:          "Under The Stars" - Final Fantasy Tactics

Piggybacking on the darkness aesthetic, I wanted a grandiose finale chock 
full of dickery. I spent quite a bit longer on this map compared to the 
others, mostly due to its larger scale. Every perched boss monster can be 
telefragged, don't waste your ammo!
