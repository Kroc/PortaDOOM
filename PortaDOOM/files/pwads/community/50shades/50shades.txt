Description             : 50 Shades of Graytall is a project designed around creating maps with interesting architecture and gameplay despite being limited to a selection of arguably hideous textures. Started in response to a silly post made in the Editing forum which led I and several others to attempt maps using the (slightly edited) rules in the post, hoping the result would be decent. Eventually opened up to the community and here we are! Hope you enjoy the maps and if you don't hey Doom projects cant be graytall the time

Additional Credits to   : Gez, for the dumb joke that started an even dumber project. Pinchy for the Title and intermission music. Everyone who mapped for this thing (credits are in the level names gfx), Xaser for taking infinity years to make an infinitely cool map. Alfonzo for the BDSM (pls do not misconstrue)
