Uploader's note         : This is a reupload of the legendary 1997 total
                          conversion STRAIN to repackage it in a manner
                          suitable for modern users. The original version
                          uploaded to /idgames on September 14, 1997 was
                          distributed as a self-extracting LZH file, which
                          one could run only in DOS, split into four pieces
                          so the user could copy them to four 3½-inch floppy
                          disks and install the WAD that way if they wanted.
                          Because both DOS and floppy disks have been
                          obsolete for decades, this method now serves only
                          to deter all but the most tech-savvy users from
                          playing it, and thus it has been repackaged as a
                          regular ZIP file.
                          
                          strain.zip contains the complete contents of the
                          self-extracting LZH extracted with another program
                          so that the timestamps are preserved. No files are
                          needed to play the WAD in modern ports apart from
                          STRAIN.WAD and STRAIN.DEH, but they are included
                          anyway for historical accuracy.
                          
                          The WAD's permissions (see below) allow it to be
                          redistributed as long as the original text file
                          and package are included with no modifications.
                          Thus, the original 1997 strain10.* package is
                          included as two separate files complete with the
                          original /idgames archive timestamps, not only to
                          follow the permissions but once again for
                          historical interest. The original package also
                          remains available on the archive itself as a
                          separate download.

Description             : STRAIN is THE largest DOOM II Total Conversion. And
                          it's FREE!
                          
                          This is the product of our painstaking effort at a
                          true successor to DOOM II. We hope you'll agree
                          that it is much better than 90% of all those $50
                          shovelware first person shooters that wish they
                          were DOOM!
                          
                          STRAIN includes 32 new levels, all new music, and a
                          complete story which carries through the levels. 
                          It also contains 100+ new textures, and many new
                          baddies, weapons, graphics, and sound effects. 
                          Yes, that's right: new baddies and weapons!
                          
                          Designed for single play with special support for
                          co-op and deathmatch play.  All difficulty levels
                          supported - from beginner to DOOM god.

                          [This WAD has been repackaged for access by modern
                          users. Now you can just load STRAIN.WAD and
                          STRAIN.DEH in your port of choice and play!]
