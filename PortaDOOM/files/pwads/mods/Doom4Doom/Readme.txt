* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch 
Build Time              : Something like 6 months
Editor(s) used          : Slade, Programmer's notepad, GIMP, Audacity,
                          Notepad++, Paint.net, FL Studio, GitKraken
Known Bugs              : Sometimes glory kills will only do a quick punch
                          of death instead of the GK animation. Mastermind
                          GK will never show full animation due to tech
                          limitations.
                          Sometimes glory killing will make monsters clip
                          through walls, floors or celings while being
                          executed.
                          If you use GZDoom devbuilds, HUD elements might
                          look off. GZDoom 2.2 is recommended.
May Not Run With        : GZDoom current devbuilds. Will NOT work with 
                          Zandronum. It might run in ZDoom but it will look
                          like crap due to color limitations.
Tested With             : GZDoom v2.2
