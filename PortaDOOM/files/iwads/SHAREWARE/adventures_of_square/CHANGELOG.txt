----------------------------------

1.4
...

- Base engine is now GZDoom 2.4.0! This will re-unify the versions into one
  download! If you want the GL renderer, select it in the video menu and 
  restart!

- Weapon makeovers!
- Spruced up the TITLEPIC a bit.
- Re-did the menus to use language entries and added/changed some sections.
  Lots of things may be reorganized from last version. Sorry if this confuses
  people.
- Tweaked Jetpack Jerk graphics to make less object pool pollution.
- Ovolts revamped: New looks, better Ovolt death sounds, and they're more 
  robotlike.
- Adjusted damage from Ovolt explosions.
- Slight Chatterbox sound tweaks.
- Metal debris now has sounds to tickle the eardrums when you're blowing up robots!
- Actors: Making sounds stop on deactivated fountains was using a deprecated 
  method.
- Actors: Fixed precision problems in some random value ranges.
- All Maps: Fixed bad or garbage data causing issues in slated (G)ZDoom builds.
- Sound: Adjusted some sounds played by exploding enemies.
- Destructinator's "lock-on" crosshair's height was changed due to engine changes.
  This has been fixed.
- Adjusted damage that Square takes from green goonade goo.
- A bunch of "modern" robots now explode with fragments of some mysterious 
  material...

- Fixed some invisible walls on cliffs in E1A3 (and still prevented the player 
  getting up there).
- Added a game hint about crates in E1A3.
- Extended the ladder to the yellow key path in E1A3.
- Some slight powerup changes in E1A6.
- Fixed some "node holes" in E1A6.
- Made a switch in E1A7 not locked.
- Moved the passcode disc in E1A8 to a more findable location.

- The Fishtank uses a better effect that does not wash out the vibrant colors
  of Square's universe. You also get an audible/visual warning when you are 
  about to run out of air!

1.3.2
.....

- Square Jabber chance can now be set. Default is 15%. If you already disabled
  this before, you'll need to set it 0 again. Sorry.

- Some sprite facelifts.
- Goonade puddles now do the damage the airborne globs do. It was different 
  for some reason.
- Goonade goo also always makes enemies flinch, to convey that it actually is
  damaging and to make it slightly more useful.
- Adjusted the "fast" speed of the Dark Ovolt attack. This makes them a tad
  more fair in Cubular.

- It was a mistake making all the NPCs extend ScriptedMarine. Now they just 
  extend SquareMonster.
  
- Hellshell sub-explosions no longer thrust the player, making Hellshell-
  jumping much more consistent.
- The cows in E1A10 looked a little chilly, so we gave them some winter wear.
- Some fountains that were red should have been purple due to a typo.
- Yellow giblets are now the proper yellow for the GL ports.

1.3.1
.....

- MAPINFO skill definitions changed to not interfere with existing skill 
  definition names. Also added "clearskills" to ensure that existing behavior 
  is not copied in the future.

- Tweaked Color Cube behavior - now they won't fire the same type of attack 
  twice in a row.
- Tweaked Goonade damage for more overall effectiveness, not just direct hits.
- Goonade direct hit damage varies with force of throw. Max power = max damage.
  
- Fixed some maps with forcefields that hurt enemies when they touched them.
- Cleaned up some automap lines.
- Added a hidden gag to E1A8 that we really wanted to add earlier on in 
  development.


1.3
...

- Core ZDoom and GZDoom version updated (2.8.1/2.1.1 respectively).
- Distribution split into two packages due to source port fragmentation. (Sorry!)
- Some internal reorganizing of resources for the new ZDoom versions.

- Goonades are now an offhand weapon (thrown with the ALTFIRE/GOONADE button).
  By default, this is the RIGHT Mouse Button.
- Reloadable weapons (currently just the Quadcannon) reload with the RELOAD button.
- Hotsauce renders you invulnerable for its duration on ALL skill levels, now.
  We figured it was best to keep it as fun as possible.
- Fishtanks, which can be essential, are no longer counted as "items."
- Rectangoliers now behave properly in Cubular (which, of course, is the skill
  setting that they are featured in. whoops). This means they'll probably be
  more aggressive and bothersome than usual. We're not sorry.
- Changed the "replay" button in Time Attack to RELOAD instead of FIRE.

- Added a bunch of kooky adornments to Square's face for each powerup.
- Added Goonade counter to the "block" statusbar.
- Fixed/changed the secret area message.
- Fixed a lemonade pickup message (picked up on low health).
- Fixed some sprite offsets on candles and torches.
- Status bar is now removed/changed during intermission.
- Tweaked some VO timings for when Square dispatches a baddie.
- Giblets now bounce off ceilings. They looked weird just stopping when hitting
  them.
- Slight menu and credits tweaks.

- Added "ladder" game hint to another ladder in E1A1. Only one will be triggered, 
  anyway.
- Changed a small section of E1A3.
- Some bars blocked projectile attacks on E1A6. Now they don't.
- Fixed "unknown things" on E1A6.
- Changed some Block Player lines and Walkable Lines in E1A8 to be shot through
  or walked on.


1.2
...

- Slightly better implementation of the "Promo" fix.
- The ammo packs dropped by some circle guys could get crushed under doors and
  stuff. Fixed!
- There was a bunch of bullet ricochet sounds that weren't being used. Time to 
  remedy that! Stuck them on some enemy bullet puffs so Square knows he's 
  being shot at.
- Shatterboxes explode differently now, to differentiate them from other 
  enemies that behave similarly (or WILL behave similarly...).
- Updated Destructinator crosshair. Slightly more informative.
- Some powerups were not clearing when the intermission screen was reached.
- Fishtank duration increased to 90 seconds.
- The Locationator now shows all automap objects for 30 seconds (map is still
  revealed for the whole level). Shows up as "Scanner" on HUD.
- Changed around some powerup HUD labels.
- Added some forcefield powerdown sounds.
- A single Oozi Jerk frame had fullbright pixels on it when it shouldn't have.
- Some maps never had all 8 Co-op starts! Guess nobody plays Co-op, or we would 
  have heard about it!
- Throwing Goonades and dropping crates no longer alerts enemies.
  
- Square now has a LOT more things to say.

1.1.2
.....

- Changed some "fullbright" pixels on some sprites, notably the robotic enemies.
- A mode called "Promo Mode" would still be active even if it were disabled. 
  Fixed.
- Added licensing information for end-users.

1.1.1
.....

- Tweaked the output levels of some sound clips.
- Last patch broke Square's voiceovers when picking up Defibs. Fixed!

1.1
...

- Added a "strength meter" to Goonade throws so that the throw force is more 
  easily determined.
- Made explosions and smoke/steam effects look better (smoke billows).
- Quadcannon fires 12 pellets instead of 10, firing spread adjusted slightly.
- TNT crates explode a little more strongly.
- Nuke crates damage less on initial explosion.
- Fizzo crate explosion damage reduced dramatically, but now they blast things
  away like the defibs!
- NPCs now go immediately into a FRIGHTENED state when shot.

- Added small boxes to the Square key balcony in E1A1 to convey rail-jumping 
  feature.
- Modified E1A8 slightly to convey Fizzocrate mechanic.
- Fixed a place in E1A9 where the player could get stuck between crates.
  
- Enabled in-game hints by default (reminder: they can be turned off).
- Added subtitles (and subtitle system) for some voice clips. They too can be
  toggled in the menu.

- Removed TRAINING episode. Deemed unnecessary. It's still reachable in the 
  game via console: "map training"

1.0
...

- Out of beta!

- D_E1A4 and D_DM04 had doubled notes.
- Souped up D_E1END a bit.

- TITLEMAP now has a name (for console messages).
- New sprites for Square player character and all NPCs. 
- NPCs also now have additional "frightened" frames.
- Switch "defaultmap" to "gamedefaults" in global MAPINFO. Makes
  better sense this way for add-on maps.

  a tad too beefy.

- Added hint system and hints to E1A1.
- Some ammo adjustment on E1A1 after Shotbow addition.

- Culled some health items on E1A4.
- Added a secret to E1A4.
- Changed a secret from an item secret to a sector secret in E1A4.
- Highlighted the Shotbow in E1A4. It could've been easily missed.
- Changed a trigger in a secret area.

0.9 Beta 5 (RC1)
................

- Altered handling of credits slightly for title screen.
- Made a bunch of un-interactable effects and objects client side only
  for one day when this is supported by ZDoom-compatible multiplayer ports.
- Modified speed and random damage of enemy attacks.
- Tritankle pain chance increased from 90 -> 100.
- Fixed default "unseen lines" automap color to be more visible.
- Adjusted ammo in CUBULAR (using actor defs). Most ammo is roughly 1.5x.
  Hellshells are not increased.
- Adjusted behavior of Rectangolier - it may randomly break out of the 
  charge, now: makes for more erratic movement.
- Adjusted behavior of Anglefish - it may randomly break out of the 
  charge, to prevent getting stuck on walls.  
- Changed CUBULAR to not give any ammo bonus. Good luck!
- Changed CUBULAR warning message to be a tad more informative.
- Adjusted/fixed sprite color translations.
- Changed some billboard forcing for GL.
- Changed armor graphics to something a little more in-universe; class names
  changed to fit types.
- ALLWHITE texture should not be fullbright.
- Some endgame rocket textures had an incorrect palette color.
- Fixed translation for Oozi hitscan (too dark).
- Fixed wrong armor given in IDKFA cheat.
- Fixed Hellshell explosions not spawning if there wasn't room - now uses
  a better cluster method. This changes the explosion a little bit, but it
  won't be too noticable to players.
- Music lump D_E1A4 and D_DM04 didn't play back right in FMOD's sequencer.
  This has been fixed.
- Fixed some textures on E1A1.
- Changed the bars to forcefields in the northern building, plus made
  the Square Key more visible at all times.
- Fixed an unreachable/un-alertable enemy on E1A3, preventing 100% kills.
- Changed an item secret to a sector secret in E1A4.
- Fixed a floor not rising if the player took a super-special speedrun route
  on E1A4.
- Fixed two enemies that should have been "deaf" on E1A4.
- A Rectangolier was put in a place that was surrounded by "block monster" 
  lines on E1A4. Not too effective.
- Fixed an event not triggering if the player went a different way on E1A5.
- Fixed Red Lift locking/repeating on E1A5 near northern plant.
- Made a Fizz-o-Pop in E1A5 secret. It was hidden enough to be.
- Removed railings on the eastern side of E1A8's yellow building - in order
  to keep their blocking effect, they had to be both jump-over AND walkable
  in two different places which makes things awkward depending on who was 
  attacking whom from where. Removed them and added "caution" paint to the 
  edge. OSHA would be pleased, somewhat.
- Fixed some secrets not triggering in E1A9 (also made them sector-secrets).
- Fixed a misaligned texture in E1A9.
- Created a teleporter for Co-op players to use once they progressed beneath 
  the silos in E1A9 (triggered by script).
- Fixed E1A10 exit not triggering if the player fell a certain way down it.
  Fake floor was too high.
- Fixed some ceiling textures that should have been sky textures in E1A10.

  monsters.

  hall in E1A8.
- Changed green building interior a little to make the windowed outside look 
  like it made sense with the inside on E1A8.

  fall off, plus an indication of its purpose in the map (exit lock).

  Jerks.

  10 pellets, 5 damage.
- Tweaked Oozi - increased damage per hitscan (5 -> 6), kept spread.
- Made the Destructinator more susceptible to Hellshell damage, since it 
  shrugs off explosions. (1x -> 2x)
- Weakened Anglefish health a little (50 -> 30)
