INIFILE - 32/64 bit tool, Ver 1.92 (c) 2006-2017, Horst Schaeffer
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This CMD scripting tool handles Windows type INI files with section names in square brackets, and assignments of the form: item=string (case ignored for section and item names). The INI file must exist! This program uses the functions supplied by the Microsoft Windows API. Functions:

++++ Change or add an assignment

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section] item=string

Example: INIFILE c:\some\where\program.ini [Profile] Name=John Doe

    The string is taken up to the end of the line.
    Optionally, the (entire!) assignment may be enclosed in (double) quote marks 
    (in case there are redirection symbols in it).
    In any case the item name as well as the string will be taken without leading 
    and trailing spaces.

    Example:  INIFILE c:\some\where\program.ini [Profile] "Name = John"

    If the item is not found, a new line will be added.
    If the section is not found it will be generated (at the end).


++++ Remove assignment

To remove an item: omit the string (the equal sign is mandatory)

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section] item=

Example: INIFILE c:\some\where\program.ini [Profile] Name=

    The complete item (not just the assigned string) is removed.
    If the section becomes empty, it will NOT be removed. 
    No error will be reported (see Errorlevel), if the item does not exist.

++++ Clear assignment

If you want to produce an empty assignment without removing it, 
use two equal signs.

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section] item==


++++ Remove entire section

To remove a section the security argument /REMOVE (case ignored)
is required. No error reported, if the section did not exist.

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section] /remove


++++ Get an assignment

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section] item

    (Note that an additional equal sign would remove the item!!!)

    The program will generate a SET statement, and send it to STDOUT.
    If you want to produce an environmental variable, redirect the output
    to a temporary batch file, and execute it (see also: GetOutput.txt)
    Note: Character set is ANSI (Windows), see codepage.txt. 

    Example: 
         INIfile c:\some\where\program.ini [Profile] Name > temp.bat
         call temp.bat

    If the assignment could not be found for any reason,
    the SET statement will be empty (set var=), which clears the variable.

    Note: This method must not be used if equal signs or redirection
    symbols are expected in the assigned string.

++++ Get all assignments of a section

Syntax:  INIFILE inifileName [section]
    
    SET statements will be generated for all items in the section.


++++ Errorlevels

    Errorlevel > 0 indicates an error (message to STDERR)
    0    done
    1    INI file does not exist  
    2    Section name in square brackets was not given
    255  No INI file specified or help requested (/?)

The INI file operations are done through the Windows API which handles spaces, upper/lower case etc.. There may be a size limit or a problem with long file names in older Windows versions. Please test.

Important: The Windows API functions cannot handle UTF-8 files with a BOM. Make sure your INI file is ANSI (without BOM) or UNICODE (UTF-16).
