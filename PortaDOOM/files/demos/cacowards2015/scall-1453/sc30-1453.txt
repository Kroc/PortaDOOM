Description:
My first scythe exit.

After working on Doom 2 I wanted a break and moved onto Final Doom: TNT Evilution, 
but then I needed a break from that as well (haven't done a single attempt yet, just planning\routing)
so I moved onto Scythe. Scythe is a very short wad, and it also has several easy maps, and
some difficult ones (map 3, 17, 21, 24). It's a lot of fun to run scythe compared to the IWADs, 
since you don't have to reset on map 2-4 all the time, even though map 3 can be quite a pain.

For Scythe I was only looking for an exit, as I think there would be a good chance for it to go sub 15.
Which is why I don't reset at all, no matter how bad things go, though in the end I was quite close to going above 15.

I think Scythe can go much further, sub 14 minutes shouldn't be very difficult if you use more aggressive strategies. 
Map 17 has been a huge pain for me, even though I have no trouble with it when I practiced it, but
since it got me so often in single segment I just played very safe this time. There are other places
where I put in safer strategies which shouldn't really be necessary. 

I would like to thank 4shockblast, just a day ago I asked him if he had tried to find a consistent setup 
for the red key grab on map 13, it then only took him like 5 minutes before he found a spot that requires just 
forward movement. This saves around 10 seconds for me, which also pushes this time below 15 minutes!


Map 01: 14 seconds is terrible, future runs should just reset if 13 seconds or higher.

Map 02: I'm not a big fan of tyson, again a terrible time.

Map 03: Just happy to get through this map, most runs die on this map, you can save at least 5 seconds.

Map 04: 20 seconds is better than what I usually get.

Map 05: I try to make this jump straight away, and I usually pick up the berserk pack to kill some spectres
since they will sometimes block you from below when going over to YK door.

Map 06: Went really well, I have a pretty good setup for the jump in the middle of the map, 
but sometimes you can get blocked by the hellknight or the demon, which is quite annoying.

Map 07: For some reason this rocket jump scares me, even though it's very easy compared to the
ones you find in say doom 2 or plutonia. I guess it's just the lack of a proper setup and just going
for it that scares me.

Map 08: A nice skip here, not a difficult trick, but I fail quite often here as well when I play like shit.
Just get the right position and SR50, at least it's only map 8 and not like map 24 (chasm) of doom 2 where the run ends if you fail.

Map 09: Good time, I usually don't mess this map up.

Map 10: Earlier this day I failed this trick, I thought to myself I would practice it to make sure that I never failed it again.
I found a good setup for it, but because I bounced off the wall and didn't manage to find a certain pixel I got delayed enough
to miss the damn elevator...

Map 11: Could be better.

Map 12: Horrible time, what the hell was up with that damn manc, just like map 16 he just managed to block the whole way.

Map 13: Pretty neat key grab trick, again thanks to 4shockblast for the setup, works every time, overall time could still be better.

Map 14: heh, 2% health. 

Map 15: I fell down here, wasn't sure if I should go back through teleporter or open gate. Went for the gate and got lucky
that one of the zombiemen or so shot the arch vile, terrible time.

Map 16: Also a difficult map sometimes, I hate it when you get this kind of nightmare arch vile who just keeps on attacking.

Map 17: This damn map... 41 seconds is terrible, easy to save 10 seconds here, I just didn't want to end my runs here anymore.

Map 18: Decent, I drag the manc out while I go for soulsphere.

Map 19: I should really study the TAS runs more often, then I would have discovered this amazing trick earlier. 
Amazing time on this map, got the invurnability through the wall and arch vile attacked me relatively quickly.

Map 20: Just rocket and plasma spam down everything since you die anyways.

Map 21: 42 seconds... hah, yeah, I guess this is the biggest time loss. I grab soulsphere because it increases my chances,
though I might have been better off without it this time... when I was stuck by the door I was pretty much saying:
hurry up and kill me already.

Map 22: Another garbage time, and a lot closer than it needed to be. To anyone else that runs this wad, 
you should avoid shooting the middle sector, as it teleports in some spectres etc, which can be used to block the cyberdemon.
It also triggers the arch vile and baron teleport in the RK room. So, this map should be done in sub 50 seconds every time
without much trouble.

Map 23: Awesome cooperation from this arch vile.

Map 24: Very scary map for me, I have just settled with the fact that I will lose runs to that cyberdemon...
and this should really have been a dead run right there, as he did actually hit me. I don't know how I made it through.

Map 25: Nice skip here, I also just wait for the demon to get a bit further away from the door.

Map 26: Mancubi... lose some weight, please, and let me through. You're supposed to just run straight past everything
and get to the exit without giving the cyberdemons a chance to attack, but I had to go for the invurnability this time.

Map 27: Rocket jump here because it's consistent, you can do without but I don't know of any setup for it. 
Also possible to do second rocket jump for the megasphere if you want some armor for the next maps.

Map 28: Almost failed this map, unbelievable.

Map 29: Just lost a run on this map like an hour before this run, that run was 3 seconds faster up to this map.
The arch vile ran all the way to the right and I couldn't get up, this time it went better.

Map 30: Straightforward map, once I got past the YK room with full health I knew it was over. 
Still the cyberdemon at the start can really mess you up.


I really enjoyed this WAD, but I don't think I will be going for a better time anytime soon, 
at least not until someone else improves it, which I am sure won't take too long, but even then I want to focus on iwads. 
Thanks to Dime, since most of my run is based upon sc30-1621. Also thanks to Akse for his amazing TAS run, wish I saw it sooner.

I will move back to TNT and try to make some final adjustments to the route before I go for 30ev attempts. 
I'll probably do some 30uv attempts as well, just to not get too bored of TNT.
