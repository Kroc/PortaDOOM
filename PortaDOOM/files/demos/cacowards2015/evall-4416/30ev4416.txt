This is my second exit for TNT:Evilution, first exit was 45:08 with a massive (40+ seconds) mistake on map 25.
This is the 3rd attempt that has gone past map 10, that is, 2 out of my 3 runs that reached map 11 went all the way.

I don't like speedrunning this WAD too much, well, the reason is because I have spent at least 50% of 
my time running this wad on map 1-3. I don't like tyson, and the second map is so random when
trying to grab the yellow key. The 3rd map is also painful when it comes to rng, how many of 
the hitscanners are going to hit you? is the revenant going to hit you? and spectres get in your way?
Though I figure most of it comes from making mistakes simply because I'm tired of trying to get past these maps.

Thanks to previous runners of this WAD: stx-Vile, Dime and j4rio, as well as the TAS by Istvan Pataki
and IL\episode runners. Primarily I have followed 30ev-4434 by j4rio.


Map 01: I really don't like tyson, and since I struggle so much with getting past the inital maps
I grab mega armor first, 41 seconds is average with my route and tyson skills, but obviosly
losing 11 seconds already on the first map to 30ev-4434 is not ideal.

Map 02: So after failing to grab yellow key by the jump about 10 times in a row because some
demon or that 1 imp I didn't kill managed to block me I decided I'd do it the intended way.
Not the only thing that went wrong, so terrible time.

Map 03: Difficult map, managed to get blocked by revenant, never happened before.

Map 04: Very short map, usually quite easy, but with low health this map can end right away.

Map 05: Terrible time, and very close to dying, however my method for doing this map is usually quite good.
I figured you can skip the teleporter spawns by not firing after entering the blue key room.
You can fire after get back to the centre room. I skip the soulsphere as well. Should go at least 10 seconds faster.

j4rio also mentioned the possibility the grab yellow key, ev05o037-Looper.lmp shows this trick.
Very cool trick, highly recommend to watch it if you haven't. I only managed to do this trick twice,
but I don't think there is any consistent way to do it.

Map 06: I have never been able to match j4rio's time here, even before I started going for mega armor.
I grab mega armor because I want to get through this map alive.

Map 07: Straightforward map, thought need to keep as much armor as possible.
At the end of this map I had to sit up properly in my chair because a run is starting to go somewhere finally :)

Map 08: So I want to have as much health as possible for the last sector of this map, 
because I skip the invisibility. Saves a lot of time.

Map 09: Stronghold, so many hitscanners, but with careful planning this map isn't too hard. 
Terrible time though, as I ignore monsters in the 1 room before the exit which should save 
quite some time compared to 30ev-4434.

Map 10: I don't like this map, damn revenants get in my way usually. I just want to get past this
map since there is a megasphere waiting for me on map 11.

Map 11: I told myself the first time I reach this map I am going to get an exit, 
because almost every map from now on is very easy, and I did, and this was 3rd time I reached this map.

Map 12: Straightforward map, I still managed to mess it up very badly.
First time I've ever gotten hit by archvile.

Map 13: Not too happy about 100\100 at the start of this map, but there is green armor + berzerk in RK room.

Map 14: I've never once missed that jump to the second crusher, well, I have now. Terrible time. 
For a moment there I thought I was going to get killed by the last crusher.

Map 15: Very easy map, and a BFG!

Map 16: Mega sphere on the start of the map, this map went ok, really nice amount of health at the end.

Map 17: Complete disaster, and my biggest mistake in this entire run, should get 25 seconds on this map.
I did this map differently because I had so much armor, of course I should stick to what I know,
instead of trying different routes in attempts that make it this far.

Map 18: So, just a couple of days ago I figured out how to do this map... worked perfect! That cyberdemon though... 
Thanks to stx-Vile for discovering this amazing trick! -50 compared to 30ev-4434

Map 19: Another megapshere here, straightforward map.

Map 20: Shit map, not a good time but what ever. Also I don't shoot in the last ... half of the map, 
but I'm not sure if it paid off, I do it because it doesn't teleport in the arch vile\mastermind etc.
Make sure to spend all cells, since you get 600 here.

Map 21: This used to be the worst damn map in the entire wad, it's still terrible, but I don't 
find it too difficult anymore at least. Very unfortunate about that linedef skip in 30ev-4434, so -30 here.

Map 22: I haven't played through this map normally, I don't plan to either.

Map 23: Straightforward map, some crazy jump you can do on this map, I never manged to get it.

Map 24: Same. The IL for this map has a very... intresting trick.

Map 25: My first exit had a really big mistake here, I missed the switch in the room that 
teleports you to the exit, and I paniced when I had chaingunners + a couple of barons around me
wasting a lot of plasma and I didn't really figure out how to hit the switch again, even though 
it was quite obvious you had to press the wall to lower it. This time it went fine.

Map 26: That is what I get for missing a spectre in a narrow corridor, never happened before.
Bad time, but a lot of health which is very nice.

Map 27: With this much health this map is easy, however such a long and boring map.

Map 28: Garbage time, got lost in the maze, lol.
Also remember not to skip the linedef by the archvile, I don't think there is a way up!

Map 29: Just playing really bad at this point. Figured I'd just grab the soulsphere in the start since
this wasn't going to be a great demo anyways, but enough to be an improvement if I exit.
And thank god those crushers have a fixed pattern.

Map 30: Was about time I got that chainsaw!
For a moment there I wasn't sure which platform to go on, would make one hell of a fail demo if I went the wrong way.
Figured I had enough health to just tank those revenants hits, I didn't want to fall off here.
Using rockets to kill lost souls is obviously a complete waste of time, but I didn't want to get telefragged.
Lucky with the IoS, I had a baron alive behind me but I got the BFG plasma ball in quickly.

Overall this was an awful run, I could save almost 130 seconds on map 17, 18 and 21 compared to j4rio's 30ev-4434,
since I know of a couple of tricks and making sure I knew where the linedef on 21 was. So, hopefully someone is 
up for improving this one.
