E4M8 comparison is not relevant. E2M1-E2M7 time is improved by 37 seconds.

Description: 
No major mistake, so a solid run, but plenty of room for improvement.

E4M1: 30 seconds isn't too difficult to get with this route. Weapon switch mistake by red key cost some time.
Very random map, but it's pretty much just the first 10 seconds, so I don't mind too much.

E4M2: I grab 20 plasma ammo at the start so I can use 2 BFG's without switching weapons in the last room.
I also grab BFG before mega armor, since I don't want to lose any mega armor before killing cacos.
27 seconds is better than average, 25 isn't too difficult.

E4M3: I use a rocket jump on a lost soul to reach the exit, works 50% of the time or so.
I don't think I've ever had anything besides 10 seconds on this map, 9 is possible.

E4M4: Standard route here, I don't feel like wasting a run on this map, 
I do however skip the invurnability and soulsphere. My IL record is 32 seconds with glide.

E4M5: Terrible time here, easy map though.

E4M6: Wohoo! finally, this cyberdemon does nothing but kill every run, except this one apparently!
Some infighting going on, I've died well over 15 times to this cyberdemon. At some point I had to re-think
my strategy, I thought I had tried everything when I told myself:

"Well, you could try something really stupid, like running past him straight away and try to BFG from that small room"
Cyberdemons aren't my speciality, so what I thought was a stupid idea actually worked like 50% of the time :)

This is my best time on this map I think, very happy with it.

E4M7: It's possible to jump across to the exit platform going directly from the door, 
but I don't know to do that consistently, I could still have gotten 16 seconds here.
There were a couple of fireballs coming my way, I just lost a run by failing this trick
a few attempts before this one actually, so I took it really safe.

E4M8: I have hardly played this map, time is unimportant. So, I play it safe as well.
