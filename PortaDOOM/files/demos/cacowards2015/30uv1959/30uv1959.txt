Description:
First of all I would like to give a big thanks to Looper, this would never have happened if 
it wasn't for his efforts in the 30uv category. Looper managed to improve the Doom 2 record 
to 23:25 back in 2010, the record stood for almost 4 years before I tried to replicate 
what he did, with some adjustments, and managed to get 23:03. At the time I got 23:03 
it was obvious that sub 23 wouldn't be too hard to get, and I imagined that a really solid run 
would perhaps go under 22 minutes. A few months later Looper picked it up again and managed to get 21:55.

I have always been working on improving the route for 30uv since I started even 
though I have been doing other runs as well, and I've also been practicing a lot for this run. 
For example trying to improve my movement and ability to do tricks in a consistent matter. 
After a lot of work I saw that getting below 21 minutes would actually be possible, 
and after several attempts I managed to not only get below 21 minutes, but a time of 20:32, 
a full 27 seconds faster than my goal. I really thought that this would be it for Doom 2 UV-Speed, 
but Looper decided to go for sub 20 minutes, and I saw that perhaps it would be possible as well.
With some small adjustments several places in the route thanks to Looper and a ton of practice 
I figured I would attempt to bring this time down a bit further :) 

This has been one of the demos I have worked the hardest on, the last days I was so close 
to achieving my goal of a time below 20 minutes. Sometimes you just have one of those days 
where almost everything seems to go right, and today I was playing very well compared to 
how I usually play. Earlier I failed several attempts on the episode 3 (map 21-30), 
I kept on going because of how frequently I would reach the later maps of the run this day.

I then had some absolutely devastating runs which failed on the very last maps, 
on 1 attempt I had gotten in a bit of trouble on map 28 where I failed to grab enough plasma ammo, 
which forced me to use more rockets which cost me a lot of time. I then made a huge mistake by using 
all my rockets on the cacodemons on map 29, because I needed 1 rocket to do the rocket jump. 
I then managed to get 32 seconds on map 30, but the time was 20:00, a single second away from my goal. 
Even though this was very frustrating I decided to continue due to my consistency today.

And what happened next is unbelievable, yet again I failed, this time on the very very last input I had to make. 
A single frame was the difference between 19:53 and 20:06, I pressed fire 1 frame before I pressed move forward, 
this could have still worked I think if I was standing closer to the edge of the platform like I usually try to do. 

Needless to say, I am extremely happy to be able to now bring this time below 20 minutes, 
especially today after my earlier failed attempts.

Since I started I have managed to get the following exits: 
30uv2021, 30uv2019, 30uv2151, 30uv2117, 30uv2038, 30uv2016, 
30uv2013, 30uv2013 (second time), 30uv2015, 30uv2006, 
30uv2032 (same time as previous listed record), 30uv2000, 30uv2006 (second time).

The times above are in the order of which I got them, the slower times 
like 21:51 and 21:17 are because of failed RJ on map 29 or really bad IoS.

The list of exits is only a small part of it, there are tons of failed attempts, 
many of which were in episode 3. Nothing is worse than having a very good run 
and not managing to do the wallrun on map 24, or seeing the arch vile on map 27
decide to go full nightmare mode on my ass and just keep on attacking without moving. 
I guess the only thing I actually haven't seen is the arch vile going through the teleporter.

This run isn't perfect either, there are some obvious mistakes on map 06, 14 and 22. 
It is simply not possible to get a run where you are happy with every map, but in these cases 
the mistakes were rather small, around 3 seconds or so each. Just having bad luck with for example
map 08 or map 27 can cost you 10+ seconds each. Of course there are smaller 1 second mistakes all over the place.

I am not sure if this is as difficult as Plutonia NM-Speed, though the difficulty is completely different,
one is a race against time while the other is just trying to survive, and as I mentioned in 30pn4357.txt:
"This could have happened on the first run, or the 10.000th run" 
For plutonia NM-speed I had incredible amount of luck early on, and the same thing could have happened here.
In the end 30uv1959 took a lot more attempts than 30pn4357, but both these demos will probably be the 
best I'll ever make, as I don't think I will ever find the motivation and time to push something this far.




Description of the run itself:
For every map I have a time that I usually expect to get, I then take whatever time I actually get 
and subtract the expected time to know how good (or usually bad) the run is going. 
I add up all the time differences as I go through every map up until map 15, if 
the run is going bad I know I have to do better or just reset if I fail even more. 
Once I reach map 15 with a decent time I never reset, usually it only takes another 11-12 minutes 
from here to finish the game or I die earlier, which is not too bad when you've spent hours trying to get to this point. 


Map 01: Every attempt starts here, and after 1000's of them this map gets kinda easier. 
But then it got harder because I think I can just run straight through everything, 
so I sometimes get through very often and other times I make dumb mistakes over and over again 
so I have to reset because I don't want 7 seconds. Even after all this time I still don't really know how 
to deal with the imp at the exit, he sometimes blocks the entrance completely.

Best time I've had here is 5 seconds, I reset on 7 seconds.


Map 02: The same goes with this map, after so many attempts it gets a bit easier, 
but this map requires a lot of luck. Mostly you need to not get hit while trying to do the 
glide, because it will push you away from the 32 unit gap. Then we have the barrels, 
sometimes I've been shooting at them with 7 or so shells without them going down, 
most common is 2 shots though. Then we have the position of the monsters in BK room, 
and how many shots it takes to get the 3-4 barrels.

The best time I've ever had on this map is 33 seconds (30uv2006), 
which is 1 second slower than my IL record where I use a more 
aggressive route. I reset this map if I get 43+ seconds. 


Map 03: Found this nice setup for going to the secret, works almost every time, sometimes 
I get stuck between the imps but then I simply have to fire. Then comes the jump into the "window" to skip the blue key, 
I fail this like 3 out of 10 times or so, quite annoying. I think it might be better to go through the corner window on the way out, 
because sometimes the spectres won't wake up, obviously spectres have a lot of health compared to hitscanners, 
you then want hitscanners to block the way so you can go through them instead of getting stuck in the spectres. 

My best time here is 30 seconds, 29 is possible, I reset if the total time adds up to more than 90 seconds.


Map 04: Sometimes you just get killed by the hitscanners in the start here, 
but once you get past with an ok amount of health the map isn't too bad. 
You can also get lucky and just run past the demon at the end. 


Map 05: If you play this map almost perfectly you can get 26 seconds, most likely 27 seconds 
if you don't have to use an extra SSG shot anywhere. I don't think you need any luck here at all, 
though the zombiemen might find a way to block you if you aren't paying attention to where they are when you use the SSG.


Map 06: I've switched to chaingun when I go up the elevator here instead of SSG, 
since it's more reliable. SSG would be faster if you get through in a single shot, 
but if not you might get stuck next to the revenant which can really hurt your health. 

For some reason I always play like shit on this map, losing some 3 seconds every time. 
I often screw up the last jump to the exit like this time, and sometimes I even fail the first elevator skip.


Map 07: I've had several different ideas to do this map, but this route works very often as I am usually 
able to manipulate 2 of the mancubi on the left side to a position where they can't see me, 
and kill 2 on the right side. This leaves the one on the megasphere, usually he won't fire and hit, 
if he does the run is probably over as you can't see him fire. This time I actually got the chance 
to see him firing in my direction, so I lost 2 seconds but managed to actually exit :) 


Map 08: This map is pure luck, I've spent a lot of time to reduce the chance of getting locked in 
by the cyberdemon and barons. I run over to the invurnability and shoot and wait for the cyberdemon to shoot, 
if he doesn't shoot I wait for my SSG reload to finish and count to 2-3 and go for it usually. 
Works nicely most the time now, when it fails the run is over, too much time lost.

I make sure to have at least 6 rockets for the next map, usually I want 7, 
so sometimes I go for the rockets in the YK room. 


Map 09: There is a door by the shotgunners at the start here, sometimes one of them will actually 
open the door, so when you fire it wakes up the hell knight, which is a very fun way to 
ruin a run when he manages to position himself at a non-ideal place...

If I have the rockets I try to use some on the imps on the right side, as they have managed to block me a few times. 
Sometimes you can get really lucky with the demons here, other times not. 
I had to use the first elevator this time after YK, almost never happens actually, but it only costs about 1 second.


Map 10: I hate everything about this map. First of we need to grab the BFG, and with all 
these arachnotrons and revenants around it goes without saying that if you get a stuck for 
a moment here you can just die. Arachnotrons by the blue key can block you from getting out, 
sometimes you lose a few seconds trying to reach the cyberdemon, and in the end we might have 
the cyberdemon completely block the exit, that might have been the most frustrating moment I had.

It's might be worth to skip the cells on this map like Looper does it, but I'm so used to 
doing it my way and I didn't want to look into where I have to save cells, and of course I 
don't want to lose any runs to the cyberdemon... which sometimes with invurnability doesn't 
matter anyways when he teleports to block the entire exit area, wasting so much time 
that you have to reset anyways :) 



Map 11: This one time I had the shotgunner land a perfect hit just enough to push me from 
doing the jump to the backpack, unbelievable. I've often died on this map too, cacodemons 
sometimes manage to block me twice so that the BFG doesn't always do the job. 
Having the imp scratch you from above the elevator is another fun feature of this map. 


Map 12: I take the fastest route here for the keygrab by going on the right side instead 
of the left after bumping the wall. Keygrab works half the time. I hate the elevators here, 
often I lose a lot of time.


Map 13: This is one of the worst maps in the run, entirely because of the jump down to the BK door. 
I even use the BFG here to clear the revenants, but often it's not enough. One time I even saw all 
the 4 revenants past the BK door when I wanted to BFG them, but I don't want to run up to them to kill 
them since it wastes too much time, so I go through teleporter, jump down, and just fucking die... 
got no choice really when you aim for sub 20.

Often I get blocked by imps, in rare cases even cacodemons. And if that isn't enough, 
we have the elevator to the YK, this is pure luck so I sometimes lose 4 seconds waiting for it to start going down.


Map 14: I've had some of the most frustrating moments on this map, all of them to failed RJ for 
some of the most bullshit reasons. I line up for the rocket jump, SR50, fire the rocket and 
just as the rocket is about to land I get hit by a shotgunner from the back that pushes me into the wall, 
and then the run is instantly over even though I survive it. 

This rocketjump was discovered by Looper, so it's one of the bigger changes compared to 30uv2032. 
It saves a few seconds and plasma, and it's not very difficult, but as written above, it can sometimes go badly. 


Map 15: Straightforward map, activating the switch is sometimes annoying. 
Also the pain elemental doesn't always die, so you have to just push him until you grab YK.


Map 31: Pure luck, well mostly, as long as you go as quick as possible and don't get stuck in the hitscanners.
I've never had 30 seconds on this map, I've been very close. 


Map 16: I got a really good method for this glide now, very often I get instant glide, if not I get the glide quickly anyways. 
I have however lost a lot of runs here, usually because I have the wrong angle going into the gap. Lost my best run on this map.


Map 17: Very difficult to get a good time on this map, probably because it's the longest map in the run. 


Map 18: Easiest map in the run, I have never died on this map. Usual time here is 23-25 seconds.


Map 19:
Well I've got a really "funny" story for this map, because some time ago I figured out something very interesting 
regarding the glide on this map. The glide on this map is not too bad. There is an easy way to set the correct
angle since you can use the corner by the bars so you don't move around too much, another thing that makes this 
glide a bit easier is that I can just tap strafe left (2xSL24 commands) once and very quickly get into the gap 
by using move forward. The biggest problem with this glide is that you HAVE to do it quickly, because there are spectres 
coming your way and if they get too close the run is 100% over. Now, one thing that sometimes happens is that 
when I strafe left is that I get stuck and lose all my speed and I then have to set it up again which is really really bad.
 
So every time I would get to this glide I get a bit nervous at the very moment I am about to strafe left, 
because for some "random" reason I would get stuck and probably die. But, since everytime I would practice 
this part I had absolutely no problem, maybe 1 out of 20 times or less, so I figured I would just 
ignore the problem since it happens so rarely. Now it turns out that the "random" reason for this is actually 
that I make a MF1 command just after pressing strafe left, so because I am a bit nervous I unintenonally make the 
smallest possible move forward command that I can with my mouse which then completely screws me over! 

So what I do now is that I get to the corner, get the right angle and just lift my hand off the mouse and strafe left, 
and since it's impossible to make any MF1 commands without moving the mouse, well, it works every time! I have no idea 
how many runs I've wasted because of this, but at least the only sub 20 attempt that I lost was just a few seconds ahead 
of my best time at the time, 30uv2019 (so a bad run because I had a really good E3 in 30uv2019), which was 
the run that caused me to investigate the reason for it. 

I got lucky this time since I didn't have to use any vertical mouse movement, same as in map 16.


Map 20: This map isn't too bad, I usually always get 36 seconds here now, 35 isn't too hard either. 


Map 21: Easiest glide in the game. I hope not to take too much damage here so I can skip the soulsphere on the next map.
It should be enough to only use 2 rockets on the chaingunners. Sometimes the barrel by the imps doesn't explode, and it's hard
to notice so that can be very bad. 


Map 22: Unfortunately I managed to fail the last trick on this map, so not the best time.
Everything else went pretty fine though... heh, well, I survived I guess, so it went fine :)


Map 23: I absolutely hate this mancubus, fortunately this time he didn't destroy the barrels!
The pain elemental at the end of the barrels didn't get in my way either.. that's a fun way to lose a run.


Map 24: I absolutely hate this... whole map. Getting across all the ledges without falling down, 
not getting stuck in the demons and managing to do the wallrun is as perfect as it gets for me.


Map 25: I have a lot of health here which makes this map very comfortable, I try to aim for 43 seconds here
which is my best time, but I'm happy with 44 seconds, and I also really need to get that plasma ammo in the end.
I failed a run earlier today where I missed it, obviously because of the lack of plasma. I also had a run
end because the pain elemental filled the elevator with lost souls while I had the SSG up. I didn't want to switch
to plasma rifle and I couldn't clear them, and once you lose 10 seconds it's over.


Map 26: This map did not go well, the BFG at the start didn't clear all the chaingunners, 
which then means that I am too late to reach the switch before the cacodemon teleports in.

I was also paying close attention to my plasma ammo here, I really want 120 cells for the next 2 maps.
80 cells would still do, but since I already killed a cacodemon I decided to go with chaingun instead
after I grabbed the yellow key, I didn't lose too much time on that, but it was very risky.


Map 27: Well, holy hell did you play nice arch vile. 19 seconds is unbelievable, 
my best time is 15 seconds, but I will take 19 seconds any day. 


Map 28: Complete disaster, I would say that I was mostly unlucky here, but the BFG's could also maybe have been better placed.


Map 29: This is by far the best map in this entire run! A time of 1:33 is insane, my best time ever on this map 
is 1:32 (when practicing!!), if you do the RJ without any setup it should be around 1:30, I don't think I could ever 
manage 1:32 in a single segment simply because I need an extra second to make sure I have the right position for the RJ.

I have a lot of cells for this map, so I can even afford to spend a BFG on a single imp so that I can avoid switching weapons.
Also a very nice kill on that arch vile, he can get in a position that will cost you some 2 seconds if you are unlucky.


Map 30: At this point I had no idea if I was on sub 20 minute pace, I knew I hadn't made any terribly big mistake 
earlier on, but I didn't have the greatest E1\E2 either. 

The strategy I have for this map works quite often, but of course I have failed this map a few times.
I think the worst possible spawns would be arch vile, revenant then pain elemental. There's really nothing you 
can do if the arch vile attacks at a bad moment, or if a seeker missile from the revenant is coming for you.

A pain elemental can be dealt with, as in 30uv2032, but still very very dangerous.
This map can also be done in 30 seconds, obviously I should have tried that in 30uv2000, but I don't know the exact 
time of the run and going for 30 seconds is a 2 frame window I think, which is something that I don't want to risk going for.


So, this was quite the wall of text, however writing this didn't exactly take much time compared to the run itself :) 

Again huge credits to Looper, without him I would not have had a good enough route or the motivation to push it this far!
And also thanks to everyone at doomworld.
