Description:
I cannot believe how unlucky I am, for the second time the arch-vile 
collides with the door twice without opening it. He collided with 
the door at 24 and 28 seconds, and then finally at 35 seconds to 
open it, I only lost 11 seconds this time instead of 35 because he 
bounced off a lost soul 3 times. Then getting a pain elemental at the 
Icon of Sin didn't help either.

Unlucky elevators on map 12 and 13 with a couple of times where I got blocked
cost a lot of time, dumb mistake on map 25 by missing the cells and hell knight 
survived BFG+SSG on map 29 cost about 3 seconds as well.

Map 01-09: Pretty good.

Map 10: New route here, I go directly for the soulsphere and skip invulnerability.
The cyberdemon is no problem since he will fire immidiately and he doesn't teleport
if I give him line of sight when he has fired his first set of rockets. This saves 
about 4 seconds, it's a bit more dangerous to do, but it's safe enough to be worth doing.

Map 12: Not the best elevator patern, and I went a bit too early on the last elevator and 
so I got blocked by the caco corpse.

Map 13: Got blocked by a demon and unlucky elevator again.

Map 14: In rare cases I will bounce off the wall when I am about to lower the
platform, 2-3 seconds lost here to that.

Map 15-22: Mostly good.

Map 23: Took too much damage on map 22 so I had to take the start slow. If I try
to run past the barrels with 70 health then I might end up with no health after
the chaingunners and there is no way I make it to the megasphere. This is about 
4-5 seconds lost

Map 24: The usual time, got kind of lucky with the demons at red key, thought
I was going to get trapped there for a moment. I need to switch weapon here next
time in case that happens.

Map 25: Missed the damn cells, can't remember the last time I've made that mistake.
To be fair this was done perfectly, but because of a very unfortunate position and 
with my momentum it was just enough to prevent me from getting close to the fence. 

Map 26: Just happy to survive this map, 40 seconds is as expected.

Map 27: Looks like I made a big mistake by firing right after activating the switch.
However, that didn't really make any difference as a lost soul was perfectly placed.
Unfortunately, for the second time in a row he collided with the door and doesn't
open it. 11 seconds lost and I knew it was too slow to get under 21:30.

Map 28: Went well.

Map 29: I've already thrown away 2 bad attempts at this map, so I made sure the first
hell knight was dead before jumping across. Messed up the first setup for the RJ, 
so overall a bad time.

Map 30: My strategy for this map worked perfectly, arch-vile on first spawn does nothing.
Nothing I can do about a pain elemental on the second spawn except spam BFG, none of which
hit because a lost soul will block the plasma ball. They pushed me around too much so I wasn't
sure of my position on the platform, difficult to time the last rocket since it needs to be fired
quite early and I wasn't prepared for how quickly I fell down and thus missed it.
