Description:
This took about 15 attempts, 10 of which were maps 01-02. I said 
I would never do this again, but I wanted to do a quick improvement 
without putting any effort into it with the new trick. I still wish 
it would have been below 38 minutes though. I got bullied around 
a lot on map 17, and then I failed the RJ on map 18 combined with me 
messing up map 21 cost me over a minute.

Map 01: I don't like tyson.

Map 02: Missed the red key, happens sometimes when I'm not paying attention.
Also grabbed the mega armor because I don't feel like doing the inital maps
more than I have to.

Map 03: Quite easy with mega armor, so should be easy to save time.

Map 04: Unlucky revenant, sometimes he goes down the elevator.

Map 05: Went ok.

Map 06: Nice not to screw it up this time, still lot of time to save here.

Map 07: The usual.

Map 08: Went ok.

Map 09: Surprised I saved 10 seconds here, felt really slow and I think
I could have used my cells better.

Map 10: New switch trick here, quite easy to do, setup was too slow.

Map 11: Sometimes you can get the imp to open the first door.

Map 12: Straightforward map.

Map 13: Screwed up the jump to red key.

Map 14: Died here on my attempt before this one, almost died again...

Map 15: Easiest level.

Map 16: Probably slow.

Map 17: I don't think this could have been any worse, every monster on the map
decided to come and visit me as I tried to get through the bars.

Map 18: Messed up the rocket jump, would have been decent otherwise. 
Kind of a close call during the end.

Map 19: Was a bit afraid with my health, but the chaingunner had me covered.

Map 20: The second worst level in the iwads.

Map 21: Worst level in the iwads. Completely missed that first key, just awful.

Map 22: Maybe this map is even worse, I don't know, haven't played it.

Map 23: Try not to lose too much health during the end of the level.

Map 24: Hope not to get unlucky and take damage by the hell knight or revenants.

Map 25: Fun trick to skip the map.

Map 26: It's possible to skip this map as well, it's the hardest non-tas trick 
that I know of. You would need enough health to survive a rocket jump to the window,
then you need to do the same trick as on map 05, get a certain angle and position
and then finally hold move forward for 7 tics before you fire and SL50 on the 8th tic.

I did about 30 IL attempts and didn't manage to do it, it's annoying because
it takes almost 2 minutes and so you'll only save a few second over the current
record.

Map 27: Didn't lose or gain time...

Map 28: I don't know how this was 10 seconds faster.

Map 29: I know exactly why this was 6 seconds slower, there were just too many
monsters after the mastermind.

Map 30: Hitting the IoS with the BFG is quite difficult.

I will never improve this.. at least I think so :)
