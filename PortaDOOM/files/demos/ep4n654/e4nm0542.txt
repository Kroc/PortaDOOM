E4M8 comparison is not relevant. E4M1-E4M7 time is improved by 12 seconds.

Description: This was a very fun episode to run, I might improve this further.
I do E4M6 a bit differently to the way stx-vile does it, my way is much safer, 
but also a few seconds slower. I use the same idea I used for 30pn4357 on map 24,
I kill the cyberdemon with BFG plasma balls (some tracers hit too this time). 
However, I make up for the time loss with a much better route for E4M7.

Unlike episode 2 and 3 this episode has very little luck involved with the 
route that I use, E4 on UV is also the hardest of the episodes, mostly
because I use the same strategy to kill the cyber as stx-vile used in his
NM run, which is to run up to the cyber and try to BFG him before he kills you.
There is no way I am going through the same pain as I went through with ep4-0311
by dying over and over to the cyber.

E4M1: This whole episode is just fun to run, this map isn't too bad on 
nightmare if you don't get unlucky with the spectres running off or really
bad respawns. Lucky with 2 rockets killing 3 imps by the key, unlucky with
the trigger skip on the exit.

E4M2: Start off with some infighting and grab 2 medikits and hope you don't
get killed as you jump into the other room. Several times have I gotten pushed
just as I try to clear that small gap after the switch which kills the run.

Sometimes the cacodemons will kill you really quickly when you try to grab
the BFG through the wall. 

E4M3: Grab the invurnability, get some health, armor and ammo and just exit.
So an easy map, but you will probably get blocked a lot on the way, so not
too easy to get a good time.

E4M4: Yet another invurnability, I take the start a bit slow to not waste any 
health, I will need it for E4M6, otherwise an easy map.

E4M5: Straightforward map.

E4M6: I was supposed to grab the plasma ammo, but I got pushed off. That doesn't
cost a lot of time since I also grab a soulsphere. This left me with more plasma 
ammo then I usually have, which was fortunate since it looks like I wasted a few
BFG's on the cyber that missed. This map can be done a lot faster if you just do
it like on UV difficulty, though I am not sure if I can be bothered with a run
like that anytime soon. Perhaps just skipping the soulsphere could work if you
have decent health from the previous level, I might look into that if I do this 
again.

E4M7: The route here depends on how much health you have, in this case I figured
I'd have enough to go quick at the start and grab the mega armor before grabbing
the berserk. If I have 100 health I would just skip the mega and go straight for
the red key and green armor. There's enough health on the next map to survive the 
start. If I should have almost no health then you could take the start really slow
and go for the soulsphere. 

The rest is just plasma and BFG spam, then do the skip to the exit. I make
sure to kill the shotgunners in the gap to the exit so I don't get blocked.
The rest should just be avoiding any fireballs.

E4M8: This map can be dangerous, since you can take a lot of damage really quickly.
Shouldn't be a problem if you don't waste cells.
