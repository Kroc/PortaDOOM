E3M8 comparison is not relevant. E3M1-E3M7 time is improved by 2 second.

Description: Usually I don't do too many runs per day for something like this, 
however before I got this time I managed to lose 3 runs at the very end of E3M7.
2 of them were to failing the jump to the exit, the 3rd 1 was .11 seconds that
tied the previous record by stx-vile at 5:10. So what happens when I am so close
to getting it I just have to keep going, no matter how annoying it gets to fail 
over and over again. 

Both E3M6 and E3M7 are terrible, but getting a better start than this is difficult.
Then again this really isn't that hard of a run, once you know what you are doing.

E3M1: At the start of the map you can do a linedef skip to grab the shotgun and get
out quicker. There are actually different ways you can skip this linedef, since you are 
running west you have a chance of skipping it if you run fast enough, however that is
very unreliable. The second way is to actually run around it.

The main reason this run is annoying is because of the demons that comes after.
Usually you'll take some fireballs getting through the door and then the demon will 
push you far enough back so you take more fireballs, unless you want him to bite you.  
Of course that isn't too much of a problem if you kill him in 2 shotgun shells, but 
obviously something like that never really happens (ok, maybe 1 out of 4 times).

The imps aren't too bad, depends on how quick you want to go. So if I get some good
luck with the demons I will slow things down there, or speed things up if I need to 
save some time. Best time I got here is 35 seconds, but my goal is to just get 
through this map alive without losing 3 or more seconds and save time elsewhere.

E3M2: Amazing time here, rarely do I have enough health to skip the medikit at the end.
Really lucky with the cacodemon damage rolls, 5 and 20, then only hit once by the lost souls.

E3M3: Another good time, even though it's not too hard to save a second here. 
I try to kill the 2 demons and 5 imps so I never get blocked after mega armor, 
can't be bothered dying to getting blocked from below like that. On nightmare grabbing
the BFG saves quite a bit of time.

E3M4: Really bad start, but everything else was good, so 2 seconds saved is good.
Sometimes you manage to get by the demon at the start, feels about 50/50.
Died a couple of times by the invurnability because of barrels or already low health.
I played really badly for most of my attempts, so I also failed the keygrab on this map
a few too many times. I use the BFG a bit more to make the map a bit easier and faster.

E3M5: Easy map, should always get 26-27 seconds here, this time I got 26 seconds so this
is a really amazing run at this point. I use the BFG to clear the spectres, getting blocked 
by them can be dangerous to both your health and time.

E3M6: 29 seconds is bad, usually I always get 28 seconds here, though if everything goes
really well then 27 seconds is possible. Now my route is obviously slower since I grab
the 200 cells, but from my time running doom 2 uv-speed I felt like 1 BFG shot = 1 second saved.
For example map 15 of doom 2 I would BFG the cacodemons at the invurnability secret just to
save a single second. So even though I lose 2 seconds grabbing those cells, I would except 
to save at least 3-4 seconds, of course you could just hope everything goes perfect anyways,
but that never really happens. I lost a second to the imp on the blue key, unfortunate
that he was standing so far back.

E3M7: I keep track of the time differences compared to the previous record, so 
I know I'm at -3 seconds and I only have to avoid dying and failing the last jump 
for the 4th time today. I got blocked a lot more than I usually do by the demons, 
some 3 seconds lost to that, which is a real shame, could have been an amazing run
if I dealt with it better.

E3M8: Very easy map, grab mega armor and cells and charge the mastermind and hope
you have enough health :)
