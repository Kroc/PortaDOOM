Description: 
Taking Looper's ev05 trick to the next level by doing 
it on a wall that is at an angle + damage boost :)

I came up with this some time ago and I managed to do it
with turbo, but it seemed to be just out of reach with SR50.
I figured a TAS might manage somehow by running into the wall
and getting hit at a specific tic. Turns out that's not
necessary since you can build up momentum against the wall, 
still need to take damage afaik.
