Description:
Thanks to keyboard_doomer for noticing the geometry here, I discovered
some time ago that it was possible to do a void glide on a corner like
this (on ev18) which is in the other direction (left) compared to e2m6 (right). 
I knew the switch could be activated from the outside already because I tried to 
find a void glide before I did the nightmare d2all. You couldn't run up or down 
from the left side of the map so I never bothered to actually check there and 
I didn't know it was possible at the time either.

I also had no idea you could run across the void to the other side here, 
but this being a possiblity made completing the pacifist here doable...
as long as you could actually do the void glide.

I pause at the start because it prevents me from getting thrown to 
some random angle at the first tic. This is important because I want
to do the exact same inputs until I reach the zombieguy, so I always
have 91 health getting past the initial shotgunners :)

To be honest I got really lucky getting past that last shotgunner, I knew if I 
could get him infighting I could push him, but that never happend. So I was trying 
to get some infighting with the imps and chaingunner to kill all the shotgunners. 
I was failing too much so I decided I'd try something else which was to maybe try 
and run around him. Then he actually got hit by someone so I could just push him through :)

The setup for this trick took about 4 minutes, which wasn't even that bad.
I'm just really happy I actually got it on the first attempt.

I don't think there's much point trying to explain exactly how to do this,
but the main idea is that you can do the void glide by simply pressing run forward.
The only problem is that you need to be in a specific coordinate where it works.

In order to find something I could do without TAS I first needed to find any
specific coordinate that I could get to. Getting the exact YPOS is easy as I just
need to get as close to the wall as possible. So the main problem is actually
getting to some specific XPOS, which took a lot of work to figure out. Coordinates:

XPOS = -623.000000
YPOS = 2448.000000
Player angle = 0

Keep in mind the smallest possible change/movement is 1/256^2 or about 0.000015

From using XDRE and bruteforce I found TR22 MF25 (wait until stop) TL9 MF25 (wait until stop)
TR8 MF25 (wait until stop) and finally TL5 and run forward (MF50) from those initial coordinates
gets you through the wall.

XPOS = -632.902985
YPOS = 2457.128311
Player angle = 16

If you are off by even 0.000015 then it doesn't work.

I used novert because it's possible to do 0.000015 movements with SL2 against the wall,
while I think MF1 didn't move at all, so it was much more difficult to do a single MF2 tic
rather than just a SL2 tic (SL1/SR1 is impossible).

Now of course not only did this trick make pacifist possible, this also opens up for a
episode 1 run for nm100s :) You'll have a lot more resources going into stronghold as
you can skip the whole bullshit RNG section at the end of map 08 which will kill you half 
the time if you have good health. An even better idea would be to just do the d2all while 
you're at it, heh.

Of course I hate TNT so I won't do it, but maybe someone in the future will :)

Also the pause screws up loading the demo in xdre, so the start is WT followed by 13xMF50 and then MF50 SL40...
