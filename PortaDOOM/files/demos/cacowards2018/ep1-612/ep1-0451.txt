E1M8 comparison is not relevant. E1M1-E1M7 time is improved by 6 seconds.

Description: 
Real shame about E1M5, when I saw that 1:07 I was thinking I'd end demo right there.
However I had a really good start, and then I followed it up with a pretty ok E1M6
before getting an amazing E1M7. E1M7 uv-speed record is 1:15, of course I have the
advantage of having weapons, but a 1:12 in an actual episode run is crazy.

As always I don't do the route for E1M8 because all competition has been for
the ExM1-ExM7 times, I think you should always get either 25 or 26 seconds on 
E1M8 if you have 10 rockets. It takes 7 or 8 seconds to get those together with
the soulsphere on E1M6. Of course going for the void glide is an option.

I use rockets a bit differently compared to last time, and I grab an extra rocket
in the dark room at the end of E1M5. I think this route is superior, would love
to see someone else find improvements for E1, I'm sure there's seconds to be found
somewhere.

E1M1: I will never bother with 11 seconds here, and always reset on 13 seconds.

E1M2: Good time, I sometimes take 26 seconds even and try to get a good E1M3 time.

E1M3: IL record is 40, so a 41 is really good. Think I got kind of lucky with
the early shotgun blast to the demon so I only had to shoot it once to kill it
on the way back. 

E1M4: I pretty much always get 16 seconds here, lucky to not get blocked by that 
imp by yellow key door though.

E1M5: Great run so far, getting blocked at the start by the shotgunner and the
demon is easily avoidable, but I messed up so I was off to a bad start. At least
I didn't get too badly blocked going for the linedef to activate the bridge.
Yellow key door was a disaster, hardest part of the run anyways, getting up
that elevator quickly. Then of course there was the blue key part... I didn't
even know you could avoid waking up the spectre there, so I had to kill him
because I messed up. The exit door was a mistake too, I didn't block the spectre
behind me properly.

Lots of time lost here.

E1M6: Surprised I got 1:00 here honestly, thought it would be a lot worse.
Thankfully the shotgunner that blocks the wall didn't shoot or something.
I forgot what a good time here would be, I think a lot went ok here, but
not exactly perfect.

E1M7: Wow! IL record is 1:15, 3 rockets + chaingun obviously helps a lot,
but a 1:12 in an episode attempt is crazy. As perfect as it's going to get really.

E1M8: A little bit disappointed I failed that jump at the end, but I already
lose 50 seconds or so here to the lack of rockets.

I would have liked to have gotten a good E1M5 and E1M6, unfortunately it means I would 
have to get 4:50 or lower now, which might be a bit too much for my patience these days.
Hopefully someone else will improve it, but it's been 3 years since 4:57 already :)
