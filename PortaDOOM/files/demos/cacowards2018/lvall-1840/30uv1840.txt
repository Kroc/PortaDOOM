Description:
I would have improved this sooner, but I had an unbelivable run of bad luck. 
This is my 50th demo for Doom II to finish map 30 where 1 is nm100s, 18 are 30nm and 31 are 30uv.

Big mistake on map 19.. maps 12 and 13 were really bad, 15 and 23 were bad.. 
otherwise a decent ep1 with a decent end.

Map 01: I never bother with 5 seconds here, part of the reason is because I start 
with WT tic followed by MB50 tic for some reason. So I waste about 3 tics which 
makes it more difficult.

Map 02: If I had more motivation I'd go for the more aggressive strategy which is to 
just shoot a shotgunner or two before attempting the glide. No double kills and a slow 
glide lost me a few seconds, at least the barrels were good.

Map 03: Lost either 1 or 2 seconds to missing the mega armor, only had to move forward 
for 1 more tic before starting to strafe, so it was close.

Map 04: I always get 29 seconds here, so I'm happy with 28.. though getting past the 
demon would save another second. 

Map 05: I like how this map isn't very difficult on UV unlike NM. Sometimes the zombieguys 
wake up and block me after the elevator like this time, if they don't then 26 seconds 
shouldn't be too hard.

Map 06: I've been getting a lot of 54 seconds here, which is incredible considering I use 
the slower jump to the exit which costs 1.25 seconds or so. 53 seconds should be no problem 
if things go smoothly and you do the jump the usual way, but I can never do it consistently 
for some reason. 

Map 07: I don't know how many times I've shot a rocket at the second mancubus only to have 
the rocket explode on the edge of the exit platform. I have no idea why that even happens, 
as it's impossible if there are no monsters. 

Map 08: Average time, cyberdemon started firing very quickly this time. After underhalls 
this is the most luck based map, all because of the yellow key room. I tried a lot of 
different things here to see if I could get something consistent, in the end I went back 
to what I originally did and it works really well. I would love to see a better route 
for this room as I am convinced something better exists, but I've wasted enough time on this.

Also I swear I picked up those 5 rockets in the red key room.

Map 09: I do a second rocket jump on this map if I have the health and rockets for it. 
If I have a lot of health like this time I can risk doing it with 1 rocket, but I would 
usually shoot a rocket at the imps first.. but that's not actually an option when you 
only have 1 rocket left.

For the first rocket jump I managed to do it much more reliable then before, 
unfortunately I would often screw up my inputs when I did it quickly, so I slowed 
it down and went with a slower setup to make sure I get it more often. Overall a 
decent time, but I could save another 2 seconds with a quicker first RJ.

Map 10: A quick setup for the blue key grab, it usually never works, but at least I never 
skip the linedef to open up the wall which is more annoying. A SSG shot will always 
kill a demon if it hits.. unless of course blockmaps have a thing to say about it.

Map 11: My aim was bad and so I missed one of the imps twice, at least I got around 
him anyways, though I probably lost a second.

Map 12: I usually get around 43 seconds if I get the good elevator pattern, 46 seconds if not, 
but I took the slow way around at yellow key and I got blocked by the last cacodemon for a couple 
of seconds so I get 48s.

Map 13: Bad time, but at least I didn't get blocked going for the 2 jumps which would be terrible. 
The elevator to yellow key can either start going up or down, if it starts going up then 
you lose 3 seconds, non-TAS it's impossible to do anything about, so 3 seconds lost. 

Map 14: Really good time, though not too difficult assuming you don't get unlucky with damage taken.

Map 15: I try to clear as many hitscanners as possible that are able to hit me before 
attempting to press the switch. I still got hit and so it threw me off a bit and I could 
have been quicker with it.. then I didn't grab the blue key because I lost some of my momentum 
for some reason, if I changed some of the MB4X commands to MB50 I grab it easily, so a bit unlucky here. 

Map 16: I mostly get 13 seconds on this map.

Map 17: For this map I play a bit careful, at the start I skip a linedef so that there's 
no chance of an imp scratching me from above. You can also grab red key and run straight 
back while activating the linedef to the wall, however, sometimes the cacodemons can teleport 
out of the room. I don't think it's very likely, but sooner or later the caco will teleport 
early and hit you when trying to activate the switch behind YK door. 

It's possible to save a lot more time on this map, 1:02 is my best time, but you'd have to 
take a big risk in ignoring some of the monsters and you'd need a really quick switch press. 
So that's impossible, but a 1:08 or so wouldn't be too difficult here.

Map 18: I was telling myself I should switch to plasma instead of using the SSG, but it I decided 
I'd go with the SSG and so I lost a second. Should always get 23-24 seconds here.

Map 19: I have 2 options at the 32 unit gap which is to press strafe left for 1 tic, 
wait, and press it again for 1 tic or to press it once for 2 tics. So when I want to 
press it for 1 tic I sometimes accidently press it for 2 tics, which is fine as long 
as I haven't already pressed it for 1 tic. Now what happened here is that I pressed 
it for 1 tic, waited, then pressed it for 2 tics by accident and repeated the same 
mistake 3 more times. Now if the spectre catches up and bites me from the side I'd 
have to kill some 20 spectres which would obviously take forever. So naturally I tried 
to get into the center of the 32 unit gap as quickly as possible, but then I risk the 
chance of going past it if I'm moving too quickly. So then that happened and I wasted more time, 
and eventually I did get bitten by the spectre.. however, it was directly from the back 
which doesn't push me to the side, so I can still get through!

Map 20: It's possible to skip the linedef to the elevator which is on the edge of the teleporter 
by going very slowly. I try to make sure I run forward down the middle of the teleporter, as it 
should be impossible to skip the linedef that way unless you get hit in the back by a lost soul. 
35 seconds is perfect for me.

Map 21: The only dangerous part of this map is the second glide, which I have also gotten 
a lot better at. I am able to get it very quickly, so this map is not nearly as scary as it used to be. 
Still though, you can get an unlucky chain of fireballs that makes it impossible.

Map 22: I fire a BFG after going through the last teleporter to hopefully clear the everything that can 
block me which worked really well, I can't really recall killing the revenant with tracers before.

Map 23: I'm not sure if my previous strategy to try and keep the mancubus from being in a straight 
line along the axis reduces the chance of him firing here. Sometimes I would test things and they 
would work 10 times in a row, but then fail 5-10 times in a row when I try it later. Anyways the 
barrels stayed up, but then I got blocked by the pain elemental, nothing I can do but wait for him 
to get lost.

Map 24: 40 seconds is pretty bad to be honest, I should get around 38 seconds most of the time.

Map 25: Got blocked a few times so 44 instead of 43 seconds.

Map 26: A cacodemon teleporting at the start is usually 50/50, it wastes a few seconds + 40 cells, 
this time that didn't happen and I got a decent time. I think it's easier to get a better time on 
this map on nightmare, but at least it's hard to die on UV.

Map 27: I expect to get 15-19 seconds about 80% of the time, 15% of the time I expect to get 20-23 seconds. 
The remaining 5% the vile will go full nightmare mode and do nothing but attack or run by the door 
without opening it and eventually kill me. Maybe 1% of the time I'd expect him to go through the teleporter.

Map 28: A bad start cost me a second, I mostly just get 41 seconds here otherwise.

Map 29: I've had 2 attempts that should have been around a high 18:2X / low 18:3X die here. 
The first one was to the first revenant which I could not kill with a BFG because I was lacking 
10 cells. He hit me with a max damage projectile as I was going for the jump to the platform. 

The second attempt is one of the most absurd ways I have ever lost a run, after hitting the last 
switch and trying to get out I had a cacodemon in my path. So naturally the only solution is to 
shoot him with a SSG to push him out of the way. I continue on and eventually get ready to do the 
second rocket jump, and as I am moving I suddenly get blocked and pushed down into the lava. 
I was shocked because in my mind this should be absolutely impossible, because a cacodemon cannot 
ever start moving to that area on his own before I get there, and he would never have the time to reach it.

So how did the cacodemon get there? well the SSG blast sent him flying at an incredible speed 
and it placed him perfectly to get stuck briefly between 2 pillars in that area. He then manages 
to get free from these 2 pillars at the perfect time to go unnoticed and just barely collides 
with me as I got for the RJ.

Plenty of cells this time made the start more comfortable, but the rest could have been better.

Map 30: Anything besides an arch-vile should be fine here, though a revenant on the upper left 
edge with a perfectly timed seeker projectile is pretty bad too.
