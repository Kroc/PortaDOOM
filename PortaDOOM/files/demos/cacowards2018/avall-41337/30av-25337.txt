Since I've played this wad countless times out of trying almost every existing doom mod on it I figured I had half of the work done to max it. I don't know if I'll do this with another wad as this took quite some work to route and to run.

That 10 minute map30 had me shaking on the last elevator cause I knew it was my last chance. Played the last few maps pretty safe. I think I have an ep1 run in sub 38 somewhere.
