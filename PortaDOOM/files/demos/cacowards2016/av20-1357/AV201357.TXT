Demo entry #147

Description:

Yes, revisiting the grandest AV map was on my to-do list for quite a long time.
I wanted to get rid of that half-assed 16:36 record (done in December 2010 by
the poor old version of me). Soon after I started my recording sessions, j4rio
uploaded his exceptionally strong, truly modern-class 15:13 run. Some of my last
ideas came to his mind as well, such as using the first BFG shot on knights.

Third valid exit in 15 days of recording tries (first two were 14:09 and 14:08).
Still several hells of a lot of slow shaky actions and messy shots, but nothing
terribly sucky (even though I felt that this attempt will be a typical failed
garbage). A few entertaining near-death scenes made me keep it. Gameplay is
basically linear and has a low proportion of infights, plus j4rio's strategy was
already very well thought, so I'm satisfied despite a not-so-high percentage of
time improvement :)
