E2M8 comparison is not relevant. E2M1-E2M7 time is improved by 4 seconds.

Description: 
This didn't take very long, I've been meaning to improve this episode since it was never any good.
Not that this run is great, but it's at least a bit better :)

Mostly comes down to E2M6, it's all about that void glide + switch press, everything else is easy.
Standard times on M1,M2 and M3, dumb mistake on M4 costing me a second from the usual 42 seconds I get here.
I made up for it by getting 31 seconds on M5, usually get 32 seconds there.

Actually E2M6 is all about the switch press now, found a quick way to do the void glide, works most the 
time if I do it correctly, but it has been 50\50 during attempts. Got 29.17, so close to 28 seconds
which would have been amazing for me, but I'd take 29 seconds any day.

Also a standard time on E2M7, but usually it's also 50\50 if I get 12 or 13 seconds, not sure
if this setup I use can do 11 seconds, it always works if done correctly at the cost of a second.
I had no idea if I had the correct angle\position and so I actually just got lucky here.
Of course the normal way of doing the RJ works everytime if done correctly too, but it's much
harder to time the rocket.

Didn't mean to take a rocket on E2M8, scared me for a bit, at least I didn't have to go and pick 
up extra rockets this time, time doesn't matter though.

Still the easiest of the ultimate doom uv-speed episodes to improve further.
