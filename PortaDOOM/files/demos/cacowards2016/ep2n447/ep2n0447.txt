Description: I never want to see E2M1 again. I did use -longtics

E2M1: This run would be a lot more fun and make me burn out a lot less often if this map did
not exist
I got very lucky 

E2M2: Nothing interesting to say.

E3M3: I find this level to be more difficult than it really should be, I usually died
right into the room after blue door, or to caco in exit room

E2M4: I died to the barons to many times to count here, or just simply fell off on the
raising platform to the soulsphere trying to be to fast.
E2M5: Map usually goes pretty well, I had been getting caught on the imps the last few runs.

E2M6: I really suck at the voidglide, or glides in general. switch press with no vert movement
is nice though

E2M7: I usually screw this rjump u took extra time grabbing rockets.

E2M8: I always get turned around on this map with as to where the cyberdemon is. 

Still plenty of time that can be saved, but the first maps are no fun at all.
