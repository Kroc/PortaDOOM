Description:
With the recent interest in this level I decided I'd try to work some magic
and attempt to find a way to get this void glide with some sort of method...
I did not expect to find anything, but I did! :)

There's pretty much 3 parts to this level, press the switch and get the rocket 
launcher without getting blocked too much, void glide quickly and press the switch 
quickly. 

I got 18 seconds without too much effort, I knew I had to go for 17. While
it didn't take a crazy amount of time to get 17 seconds, I'm not the one
with enough patience to manage a better time than this. It's possible to
save several seconds if you just get everything perfectly, but the chance
of that is so extremely low that I don't see this one ever being truly optimized. 

Before I saw the final time I knew it was going to be super close, I really
felt that was just a tic under 18 seconds, which it actually was, crazy.
