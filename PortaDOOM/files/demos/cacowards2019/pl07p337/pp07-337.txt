Description:
After watching a youtube video by decino regarding challenges thought to be impossible
I decided I'd have a closer look at this one. I will admit I would have done this much
sooner if I had known how easy it would be, it just looked nearly impossible to do without
TAS since the chaingunner seems so vulnerable and there's nothing to kill the mancs.

It's possible to wake up a baron by firing and standing on the starting stairs, and if 
you are left with 2 mancs you could manage to get them killed with the baron. However,
you can get mancs stuck by getting close enough to them and the chaingunner can
stand in a spot where he cannot get hit. So in the end I didn't even need the baron :)
