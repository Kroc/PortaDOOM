Description             : An entire megawad from scratch inspired by the
                          likes of Scythe, Plutonia 2 and many many more. An
                          easy going mapset compared to whats out there,
                          designed to appeal to anyone looking for a relaxing
                          general play through.
                          
                          The making of this WAD has been a hell of a journey
                          for me, from very humble begginings this mapset has
                          been through one serious development hell. Years
                          and years of slowly getting better at mapping and
                          writing music that is far beyond the scope of these
                          levels now, but im still very happy with the result
                          even if its aged.
                          
                          Anyway, enjoy!
