Title                   : Mutiny (A Doomworld Community Project)
Filename                : MUTINY.wad
Release date            : September 13 2016

Description             : Mutiny is a 16-level, Limit Removing Community 
                          Project Episode for Doom 2 intended to be the 
                          spiritual successor of late 90's cyberpunk themed 
                          wads such as STRAIN, Hacx, Nimrod, Dystopia 3, 
                          and Perdition's Gate. It features new colorful, 
                          high contrast, (intentionally retro) textures 
                          inspired by the works of Iika Keranen and 
                          Anthony Czerwonka, complete with plenty 
                          radioactive signs, warning stripes, computers, 
                          slime, and rust.

Story                   : It's 2028 AD. You're an elite cyborg marine. The 
                          UAC has risen as the most powerful 
                          megacorporation in the galaxy, and has 
                          commissioned you along with its squad of crooked 
                          super soldiers to maintain order on Earth. You 
                          were sent on a mission to New Orleans to defend 
                          the city from the recurring invasion of the 
                          cybernetic mutants. When your helicopter is shot 
                          down over the bay by friendly fire from renegade 
                          UAC marines, you and your squad mates crash land 
                          in the harbor and are presumably dead. At least 
                          until the shockwave from a nearby EMP missile 
                          explosion shocks you back to life. You swim to a 
                          nearby submarine deployment station and begin 
                          your rogue mission to crush the UAC, destroying 
                          anything and anyone that crosses your path.

==MUSIC==

Musical Director: Alfonzo

"Mutiny definitely comes across as a call-back to the vibrant, 
colour-rich mapsets of the late '90s like STRAIN, and so within 
the limits of 30in30 I tried to pick out tracks that would pair 
with this imagining. Jimmy's speedier compos tend toward strong 
refrains and structures - sometimes cheesy, sometimes ill-suited 
for Doom - so there was plenty of opportunity to fashion something 
unique using angry, guitar-driven tracks and some pop-like elements, 
without going overboard. I think it worked out okay!"
