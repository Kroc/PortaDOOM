Extra Notes: I had fun making this... you guys are probably gonna think I'm on crack or something. Lots of colored lighting is used, and so I've included a software renderer friendly version. It won't look as nice but at least everything won't look ugly.
Lud's Note: Removed software renderer friendly version. Can't jam 2 versions in one map.
