Description             : The Ultimate instalment in the TWiD series of WADs,
                          comprising nine levels that were designed by a hand-picked
                          team to both look and play as though they came from the
                          minds of Romero, McGee, Green, Anderson and Willits. *

                          Liberties have been taken to ensure a mostly authentic
                          experience that is a little more consistent in its
                          difficulty than the original, but no less varied and
                          surprising. Expect devilish designs and unforgiving traps.
                          Expect Thy Flesh Consumed :)
