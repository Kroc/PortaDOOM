Description             : "...It was the pinnacle of burgerdom. Finally,
                          the long summer's study in Aberdonian cuisine
                          and bovine mating rituals had yielded of a
						  supple, juicy tower clad with buns too good
						  to slap and the fattest sow the YEDS had ever
						  sewn. The chief engineer-turned-overlord of
						  foodstuffs, Percival Mechacook, deemed it
						  necessary to awaken Shaitoken from his long
						  winter's slumber to celebrate this yuletide
						  achievement. Together, they would drive the
						  Yeoman Engineers of Software and Design into
						  a golden age of quality dining and
						  unencumbered festivity. Christmas would take
						  on a whole new meaning, and this time there
						  would be no mistakes...
 
                          The burger was transported cross-country
						  with 48 (respectably delicious) dummy-meals
						  for protection. It was these meals that
						  prevented the dreaded Hamburglar from eating
						  everything in the back of the truck, his
						  gristly whiskers lapping up the meat with
						  fevered relish. Instead, the disgusting tramp
						  of a man was only able to consume a whole 7
						  of the burgers before his stomach gave way
						  and he was forced to ship the rest of them
						  to his top secret Threecock Christmas
						  Facilities for quality assessment.
 
                          One of these facilities now houses The
						  Prize... but how long before it goes bad,
						  or is eaten by the Hamburglar? Will this
						  meaty masterstroke be the saviour of
						  Christmas, or its ultimate undoing?"

                          ...

                          And the Hamburglar puzzled, till his puzzler was sore
                          Then thought of a thing that he hadn't before!
                          "Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from McDonalds."
                          "Maybe Christmas... perhaps... cannot be robbled!"
                          And what happened then? Well... in Doomworld they say,
                          That the Hamburglars hidden penis grew three sizes that day!

                          And then he was arrested for lewd conduct with Joe-Ilya
                          in the men's room of a McDonalds. The Yeoman Engineers
                          and Designers of Software carried out the arrest and
                          swiftly carried out a military tribunal. Hampton C.
                          Burglar was found guilty of billions of counts of
                          burger larceny and poorly concealing his penis in the
                          titlepic and sentenced to death by firing squad.
