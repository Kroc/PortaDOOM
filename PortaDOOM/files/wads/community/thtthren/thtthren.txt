Story       		: One of the more important and highly secret UAC
			  installations has been severely compromised by
			  a demonic invasion from Hell. There are reports
			  of near complete annihilation of all personnel,
			  however the worst part is, that it is now
			  painfully clear that the UAC executives screwed
			  up as they stationed one the military's top
			  generals there to oversee the completion of a
			  multitude of secret projects. The UAC knew that
			  these installations would be a high priority
			  target for the next attack from Hell and sending
			  the decorated general there - well knowing that
			  an attack was imminent - was a bad move. The general
			  is a skilled soldier and is most likely still
			  alive and held as prisoner; Hell knows better than
			  to kill him. His last transmission was sent from
			  inside a spacecraft. It is unknown whether or not
			  he made it off the ground. You, being one of the
			  best and most lethal weapons of the UAC, have been
			  tasked to go to the planet in search of answers
			  and to bring the general home should he still be
			  alive. If not, then your mission is clear:
			  Kill everything and avenge the general.

Description		: Ty Halderman, the essential pillar of the Doom
			  community, passed away in 2015. He is greatly
			  missed and his contributions to the Doom scene
			  have helped keep this old game alive and kicking.
			  This project tries to honor Ty with levels that
			  pay tribute to his work be it in the form of
			  his levels or contribution to the Boom sourceport.

			  For more information on Ty go to this website,
			  which has links to everything you need to know
			  about him as well as the community's condolences:
			  https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doomworld-news/
			  74184-idgames-maintainer-ty-halderman-passes-away-at-69/
			  
			  There are 20 levels in this megawad along with
			  plenty of new music and awesome new, original skies!
			  The project also uses a big part of Team TNT's
			  The Return and Final Doom: Evilution ressources.
			  We enjoyed putting this project together and the
			  level of commitment from all those involved should
			  be visible in the final result. In short: We hope
			  you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!
