Description:
stx-Vile's 30ns5600 was done in 2004, over 12 years ago! Before that it was 
completed by 3 other people: Henning, Vincent and Ryback. It was first done in 
2001 by Henning, who is the only one to have more than one exit (3 times).

Finding a route for 30ns was quick, for a few reasons. I already know a lot from 30nm, 
and many maps require none to just a few adjustments. The chance of losing over 10 seconds 
on a map is very high for a lot of the maps, so a greater focus on survival is better. 
I used 1313ns01 by Ancalagon and 30ns5600 by stx-vile to figure out where the secrets are 
and in which order to grab them. 30ns5600 is probably based on work by Henning and Vincent, 
so big thanks to those guys. Also have to mention Ryback's 30ns7155 which is keyboard only! 
that's really something crazy.

Some notes about the secrets:
Secrets are activated by standing inside the secret area, so some care need to be taken not to 
skip them. Most notable would be map 16 megasphere, as it's easy to run over it and not actually 
trigger the secret. There are several other places where this can happen too. On map 15 you can 
only get 9/10 secrets, the last secret is "below" the teleporter by the stairs inside the YK door, 
since you immediately get lifted when you enter the teleporter you never stand on the secret area 
and so it doesn't trigger. On map 27 I do a skip on an east facing teleport linedef to grab 100%. 
Maps 14,21,29,30 have no secrets.

Map description:
Map 01: This map is one of the biggest differences from 30nm. It is much more difficult as 
it comes down to the damage roll from the imp fireballs mostly. However you do exit the map 
with green armor making map 02 a bit easier and a rocket launcher which will be useful for map 04.

Map 02: I have to do this map the old way, since doing the glide with respawn is not worth it 
(saves very little time here anyways). I still skip the SSG since I don't really need it at 
this point, too used to the single barrel shotgun. I get to use a rocket at the exit this time.

Map 03: There's no need to do anything different from 30nm. Mega armor from map 02 means I'm 
less likely to lose too much health at the start.

Map 04: A few more rockets this time, so it's a bit easier. The secrets are quick and easy to 
grab here, need to be careful of the last one, since it's possible to go from RK to teleporter 
without triggering the secret. SSG for the demon at the exit is a nice change.

Map 05: This used to be one of the most difficult maps, but it's made a lot easier with the 
plasma rifle. Still not too easy, but it's much less dependent on luck now. I grab the mega 
armor before the second soulsphere to maintain my health.

Map 06: Only difference here is the secret down by the elevator and having a plasma rifle, 
kind of evens out since you're more likely to take damage from the mastermind. Terrible
mistake missing the platform, I don't think it costs any time but then I had to go and 
miss the elevator on its way up, making it 3 cycles instead of 2.

Map 07: Doing the RJ will skip the secret, so you need to make sure to bump the middle 
platform to activate the secret. Almost forgot about it this time.

Map 08: This map is completely different, fortunately you get a BFG and you have 2 invurnabilties. 
A bit confusing at first at which doors to go through and in which order, but once you get the 
hang of it this map is easy. Very easy to lose a lot of time by getting blocked.

Map 09: Plenty of lost souls and pain elementals, you can take a lot of damage here quickly which 
makes it a bit dangerous. Though there are a lot of resources and you'll probably start this map 
with 200\200 and 600 cells with the BFG. I save some plasma by using a few rockets since I'm so 
used to it from 30nm, and because I need the cells elsewhere. Best to grab the elevator secret after 
the yellow key since the PE at YK can't spawn any lost souls as there are too many of them.

Map 10: There are lots of secrets on this map, a lot of resources and 2 invurnabilties too. 
So it's not that difficult unless you have low health at the start, once you reach the green 
armor everything should be fine. Also the megasphere is 3 secrets, need to be careful not to 
skip any of them. Lost a lot of time to the cyberdemon, I handled that badly, also I lost
so much to getting blocked, maybe more practice could prevent some of it.

Map 11: It's possible to take a lot of damage at the start, but it's a lot easier than 30nm which 
requires so much luck with the cacodemons. Here the invurnability will make the last part easy, 
you still want some health for the next map.

Map 12: Very difficult map, I don't really have any easier way of doing the cacodemon room 
and that room can already be too much for 30nm. You don't really get much use for the 
soulsphere since the imps will take a lot of your health before grabbing it. There's a couple 
of berserk packs so you'll probably have enough health. 

Map 13: You'll always start this map with low health which is no fun. Luckily there aren't 
any hitscan at all on this map. For some reason I can't quite explain I managed to rocket myself,
it wasn't a miss click since I actually held fire and fired 2 rockets, I guess I just lost concentration
for a moment. Almost died because of it, so really dumb mistake.

Map 14: The same as 30nm, grab some more health because I needed it.

Map 15: I consider this to be the last hard map, and also one of the biggest changes from 30nm. 
Not much to say about it though, one thing I do is to fire after picking up yellow key so it
wakes up the pain elementals and cacodemons, then fire 2 BFG's to kill all of them. There's 
a chance they will block you when you go for the invurnability.

Map 31: As long as I have the plasma ammo to clear the demons this map is easy.

Map 32: I don't even need all the resources on this map since you get so much on the next one anyways.

Map 16: Plenty of cells and a megasphere.

Map 17: This map pretty much the same all the way up to the last elevator where I start grabbing the 3 secrets. 

Map 18: The route for the last section of this map in 30ns5600 was very strange, I had to check 
the other 30ns runs to see if the same "mistake" were made. After grabbing the last secret they 
all take a longer route instead, but during a practice attempt the exit actually closed on me once.
And since you cannot open it you would have to take the long way, I can't remember if the way was open
in the other 30ns runs, but usually it always is. This was the only part that had me a bit confused. 

Map 19: No need to do the glide anymore, but there's a different glide! The glide between the wall 
and the torch is very easy to do once you know it. I grab the invurnability straight away, this is much faster. 
I also do the torch glide at the end to save some cells.

Map 20: As always need to be careful not to step into the teleporter too quickly.

Map 21: This map is the same, well, I grab the invurnability now because saving a few seconds 
here is simply not worth it. The next map is a lot easier with a lot of health.

Map 22: Completely the same, just have to make sure not to skip triggering the secrets.

Map 23: Only difference is you have to grab a soulsphere. I got "stuck" in the barrels while doing
the wallrun, this can happen sometimes, but very rarely after I found a setup of some sort for it.
I was sure it was going to kill me, as I didn't hear the barrels go down in the second room, but
they did and the pain elementals will move out of the way when you do it like this so it's not too
bad.

Map 24: The wallrun just simply isn't worth it, say it saves 5 seconds and it fails 10% of the time, 
it would be better to have 10 runs that are on average 5 seconds slower than having 9 runs go past 
this map, since there would be a better chance of having one with an overall good time. I probably
lost more than 5 seconds with the slow speed I had :)

Map 25: Almost the same, there's a pointless secret by the end. Close call again on this map.

Map 26: This map is a lot easier the old way, which happens to grab 2 secrets. The other 2 are right at the start.

Map 27: Usually you won't get 100% on this map because you never activate the secret which is on the 
first used teleporter. It's possible to grab it by skipping the teleport linedef which is facing north.
Skipping north linedefs are much more difficult, but with either a wallrun or rocket boost they are 
possible. No rocket is needed here, lucky for me there happened to be a very easy position to find. 
I use a certain angle and move into the corner, but even then it might still fail!, so I actually 
look at a "large" pixel on the wall. Depending on my position even though I can't move any further it 
will be either 3 or 4 pixels wide. If it is 3 pixels wide, the linedef skip will fail, if it is 4 pixels 
it will work! So once I am in the right spot I use SR50 (MB50 SL50) (sometimes it will still fail, 
but I will then be stuck in the wall straight away instead of going through the teleporter.) I failed it 
the first time here because I didn't do SR50 properly.

Map 28: BFG spam everything at the start, no need to keep any remaining cells. Only 80 for grabbing the 600. 
Had a few practice runs of this map were I would forget the last 2 secrets, so I wasted some time here to make
sure I got them.

Map 29: No secrets so almost the same, no RJ this time, absolutely not worth it. Terrible mistake forgetting
the switch, I just completely forgot about it. Also missed the mancubus, could have easily died had I gotten
blocked by the barons afterwards.

Map 30: I don't care if I fail a 1 cycle here, I even spent some more time familiarizing myself with the 
cubespawn spots so I wouldn't get telefragged. Again I kind of forgot how to do this, fired way too early,
I had a new setup for 30uv that I was planning so it confused me.

Overall a lot of safe strategies compared to 30nm, it would just be better to get more attempts done 
than to go for 1 reckless run. This is because the timeloss from colliding with monsters is just ridiculous 
throughout a run like this, respawn being one of the main reasons. Saving 30 seconds on risky tricks when 
you could have saved 60 seconds by having more luck is just better since you'll have so many more successful runs.
