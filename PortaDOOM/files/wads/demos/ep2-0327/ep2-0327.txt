E2M8 comparison is not relevant. E2M1-E2M7 time is improved by 6 seconds.

Description: 
Copied the timetable format above from the previous record. 

My first episode record for doom 1, and my first demo recorded in CNDoom v2.0.3.2 (previously used v2.0.2.1)

Still lots of room for improvement, E2M5 was really bad, 31 seconds shouldn't be too difficult.
My M6 time was really really good, best time I've had is a 28, I fail this map over 
half the time because I can't get the void glide, and the rest is usually a slow switch press.

E2M1: I reset at 41 seconds, my best time was 38. 
I don't really have a plan for the demons on the lift, I just try to kill 2 of them and get through somehow.

E2M2: 15 seconds is my best time, I always go for the berzerk pack, 
though it should be a bit faster to go the other way if you have the health.

E2M3: Very close to 31, but I'm happy with 32(.06).
Shooting at the start of the map helps with some monsters moving out of the way.
I am not sure if the wallrun by the blue door saves any time. I Shoot once I open the door
to wake up the monsters on the inside and sometimes I get lucky like this time and run past everything.

E2M4: You can close\open the door instead of hoping the imps opens it for you by the blue key.
I shoot at the last teleporter so I can get past the demon on the left. Not the best time.

E2M5: I shoot when I get to the stairs to wake up imps, I also pick up the 20 cells, as I don't
think I lose any time on it, not quite sure. Time is really bad here.

E2M6: Hardest map to get a good time on, need luck to get the void glide, well, it 
might not be too random, right angle and right speed and it might work every time.
Really close to 29 here (30.09).

E2M7: Had a run that was -10 up to this map earlier, shame I failed the RJ, was looking to be 12 too.
Happy to actually get it this time, 13 seconds is fine.

E2M8: Maybe I should have practiced this more, almost died! I don't care about time here.

I might (or someone else should!) improve this further someday, 
and try to bring it to the same quality as E1 by stx-vile and E3 by kimo xvirus
