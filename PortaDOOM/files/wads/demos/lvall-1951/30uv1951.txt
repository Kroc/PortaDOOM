Yooo sup wdup

I've been running 30uv since the middle of 2014. Back in the glorious 30uv2325 days when Looper still
held the record with his at-the-time mindblowing strategies. Boy have we come a fair way since then!
Anyway I've always been on the slow side of these runs. When Zero-master got 23:03, I actually got
23:08 the same day, albeit a few hours later. I hadn't checked DoomWorld and was not aware I had already
lost! What a crushing defeat.

Fast forward to the ZM-vs-Looper battles and I had always been lingering a good 20 - 30 seconds behind
their times. I'm not a fast learner. I'm not creative. But I do have an abundance of time! So I do the
only thing I know how to do - grind. Maybe I don't grind as much as 4shockblast, but I'd like to think
I'm pretty close :D. 

So yeah after 30nm2409, I started looking at 30uv again. I had some new tricks to learn, and my movement 
was absolutely abysmal. It still is (as obvious in this demo) but I'd like to think I have improved a
fair bit. I started attempts all the way back in June of this year (roughly 4 months ago) but hadn't
been getting far as I was practicing very hard in my Overwatch teams. I've since quit OW, and I'm glad
I was able to get this very lucky run mere weeks after quitting.

This demo is proof that you don't need to have insane talent to achieve your goals. Maybe I won't hold this
record for long since Zero-Master is insanely talented and could take this back when he chooses to,
but all that matters is I set out to one day get the 30uv record, and that day came. It's a good feeling.

As per usual here are my thanks:
Zero-Master: 	For being the bane of my existence! Haha, thanks for your run. Gave lots of new strategies,
		and a means for me to compete.

4shockblast:	For constantly harassing me on Discord to play the game (and stream - sorry!) and always
		answering my questions to do with the more finnicky details of the Doom engine.

Looper:		For being a complete badass and giving me the quick tip to shoot on map10 at the cyber area
		in order for the imps to open the next door for me. Also his ridiculous find on map21 with
		the rocket glide - I happily stole that strat!

Kraflab:	For putting up with me when I constantly complain about how much I suck at the game.
   

Map Comments:
Map2
So for whatever reason, you only need to be moving under a certain speed to increase your chances massively
of falling inside of the glide gap. Using this knowledge, I found a lineup which allows me to hit the wall
TL1 left of being perpendicular. I use that to move very slightly left then correct the angle, which allows
me to drift over the gap within the speed range (most of the time) granting me fast glides!

Map3
Blue key switch was very messy. Other than that it was a pretty standard map03. I stole the elevator boost
from watching 4shockblast stream map03 nomo :D

Map4
My strategy for this run was to heavily out-run ZM on episode 1. I knew that I would lose time on episodes
2 and 3. So on map4 it's common for me to attempt the faster exit jump if I'm slower than 1:15 after map03.
I've done it a lot in nomo, so it's not too difficult to achieve now. Maybe a 50% success rate if I take it
somewhat slow like I did here.

Map5
Hit a lot of walls and stuff. 

Map6
Only had one instance of getting unlucky in this map where the imps blocked me on my way to the red door.
Everything else went pretty much perfect! Shame I didn't get the yellow keybump, but it doesn't save a
great deal of time anyway. I'm just glad I didn't fall into the slime at the end :)

Map7
Pretty much the fastest time I can get. I never bother checking for projectiles to dodge here because I
don't want to get slower than 13s. Using ZM's strat you can get 11s if you don't need to dodge any fireballs.

Map8
Until a few weeks ago, I was unaware that ZM and Looper were closing the cyber door on their way in, meaning
they could hit the door switch as soon as they picked up the key. I'm embarrassed. Anyway although I got
pretty lucky at the yellow key, I was still slower overall losing two seconds. Nothing to stress about.

Map9
I had a few variations of this map to choose from. I could do the yellow key jump (from top platform to
yellow key), the blue key jump (which I did) or both. After testing all three strats for a couple of weeks,
this one became the most consistent and saved me the most time. I got extremely lucky with monster blocks
in the yellow key room, and I almost overshot the blue key rocket jump haha. This is the fastest time I've
ever achieved on this map.

Map10
Almost lost the run at the BFG room. I've always been uncertain what to do versus those arachnotrons around
the blue key. I should probably kill them. Fast-switching on the BFG is also a trick worth doing, however I
forgot it in this run. I assumed I was going slow by the time I got to the cyber room, so I skipped some cells
in order to shave a second off the map. I end up severely regretting this later on in the run. Only main change
to this route over ZM's is I fire a shot in the cyber room (at Looper's recommendation) which moves the imps
to the next door and opens it before I get there.

Map11
Standard run. Few little bumps, but otherwise a great time. I somehow killed BOTH elevator imps with my BFG 
blast entering the Caco room. That was pretty neat hahaha

Map12
Finally got the yellow keybump. I failed that trick in every attempt leading up to it today. I almost forgot
the cell pack in the dimeCaco room which would've ended the run instantly. I'm glad I remembered. Was still a
good time, too!

Map13
Blocked by the dumb Caco after getting the blue key. Stupid monster spawn, and I wish it would go away.
Everything else went smoothly. I was lucky not to get blocked in the street just after exiting the yellow key
room.

Map14
Watching the demo it appears I let the shotgunner live on the platform next to the one I rocket jump off.
That is definitely a mistake, and I'm extremely surprised I wasn't knocked by him while I was setting up.
Nonetheless, the time was fine. Still somehow slower than ZM's even though he made a mistake, but hey that's
life!

Map15
Almost screwed up the BFG blast in the secret. Other than that the map was alright.

Map31
Slow time as usual for me. I used plasma for no reason and had bad movement at a few of the doors.

Map16
Stole ZM's strategy in its entirety for this map, however I prefer doing guided glides sideways. I don't think
I'll ever beat ZM's time on this map (even in nomo :P)

Map17
This is where I regret not picking up the cells on map10. I don't have enough rockets or cells to complete
this map efficiently. Luckily for me, I've practiced this map ammo-starved many many times. So I knew exactly
what I needed to do. It didn't stop the map being slow though. Also I made sure to get in my Linguica Seal of
Approval with the silent BFG!

Map18
Bad movement costs me a second, but otherwise it was okay.

Map19
Holy moly. Very, very lucky glide at the end. I screwed up with my mouse strafes and overshot the gap many times.
The fact I didn't need vertmouse to slide through right at the last moment saved this run. I'm not sure how that
works but I'm not mad about it! :D

Map20
Not much to comment here. Stock standard run of the map.

Map21
Oh boy. What a juicy strat! Thank Looper for this one. It took me a few hours to find a decent setup for this,
and even then I'm not guaranteed to get into the teleporter on the first rocket. Originally I didn't kill any
enemies for this to save time, but for the sake of consistency that first HK just had to go. It also gave time
for other projectiles to head towards the yellow key doors instead of the red key ones where I was trying to
glide, reducing the risk of being knocked around while gliding. Very happy with this time :D

Map22
In the heat of the moment, I decided skipping the soulsphere was going to save me enough time to get the WR.
I wish I was keeping track of my time at this point because skipping it was objectively the incorrect decision.
The bar glide happened quickly, and I took my time with the red key RJ as I usually do. The strafejump at the
end should've happened a second or so later after clearing the chaingunners. I definitely should've died here,
but the Doom Gods favoured me this day. Having the soulsphere here would've made the map much easier.

Map23
Absolutely appalling movement and reactions on the pain elementals. I'm glad the manc didn't destroy the
barrels at the start because I lacked the resources to complete a proper barrel rocket jump. Anyway yeah my
atrocious movement before the thingrun ruined my time on this map.

Map24
Quite a fast time! Been trying a new strat in the red key room where I only use one BFG blast to escape the
room. It seems quite easy to manipulate the demons as they stream out of the corridoors. Some annoying timing
windows to move within, but it's not terribly difficult. Everything worked out and the lost souls didn't
block me on my wallrun to the exit. Happy times!

Map25
Got lucky in the blue key room as per usual. This map seems to like me. I take risks here and they pay off
most of the time. The strat is almost identical to ZM's, only difference is how I tackle the BFG blast after
the blue door.

Map26
One of my faster times on this map for sure. Not entirely convinced using the SSG to clear the imps after
the blue key was the correct thing to do, but it paid off. The cacos posed a threat on my way to the exit,
but pushing them around with the chaingun seems to yield promising results most of the time. Even got the
swag double-press on the yellow bar at the end, but not the SuPeRSwAG triple press because I suck.

Map27
Identical strat to ZM. I did it a second slower. 'Nuff said.

Map28
Main difference on this map is I leave the closet monsters alive. The reason I do this is so once I come back
to the exit room, I let the chaingunners open the exit room for me with their recoil. This saves a couple of
seconds as I don't need to switch weapons before shooting the spectres, and also don't need to switch weapons
to enter the exit room.

Map29
Uh by this point I had so much adrenaline in my body that I started making obvious mistakes. Using plasma
where I needed to use BFG, missing enemies on easy BFG shots, wasting rockets etc etc. Thankfully I've
practiced the end rocket jump so many times that I got it even with my hands shaking. Still, I lose a great
deal of time here due to the compounding mistakes. I'll forever regret leaving that one cacodemon alive.

Map30
Truth be told I thought I missed the one cycle, which is why you see me go for a megasphere + rad suit.
I thought I lost the run. When I heard Romero cry out, I kicked my desk in joy :D Top5 greatest moments of
my life.



Now we wait to see what more crazy shennanigans Zero-Master has in store for us!

Until next time, pce.
