C-N entry #200(?), movie run #34.

Includes the e2m7 RJ, and that's about it.
Not having sound is an inconvenience
without certain audio cues, but at the
same time rather relaxing for speedruns.

Choice mp3s for this run:
Deus Ex - Chateau
Deus Ex - Synapse (the Hong Kong music)

Those are my two favorite pieces from the
game, available for download at Planet
Deus Ex.  Other pieces were a lot of misc
stuff from different sources.
