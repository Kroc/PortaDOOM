Description:
This is my second 30nm exit, over 2 minutes faster than my previous time, 
and 1:18 faster than the previous record (30nm2839) by eLim.

Big mistake on map 6, this trick isn't even difficult, something was off and I went into the acid with the spectres.
I was on so low health I figured I'd die, but I got lucky and managed to get out quickly.

Then I had a really solid run up until map 24 when things started going downhill.
I had just recently lost a run on map 24 to a lost soul blocking me from reaching the red key room teleporter
(and that is the second time that has happened!) thankfully that run was shit, but I get a bit shaky when I 
reach that part of the map, so I end up just taking the whole last section really slow which costs a lot of time.

Map 27 was a disaster, the hell knight kinda threw me off I guess, I got very lucky having that arch-vile
open the door twice, sometimes he just goes to the door and goes back, wasting 10-15 seconds each time.

Map 30 is the usual, I fired a bit too early and so I didn't get a 1-cycle, at least I got it second try 
and it wouldn't have been sub 27 anyways because of map 27.

Still very far from happy with this route, every time I die or take a lot of damage somewhere I end up
using some different strategy that sacrifices a few seconds for a more safe route. One example would
be the very end of map 20, usually I would just fire a rocket and run straight to the exit after the last
teleporter, but now I take a step to the right to wake up the revenant so that he will be in a better position
that decreases the chances that he will hit me. I had 2 runs where he managed to hit me with almost full
damage rockets, which is unlikely to happen, but it's so annoying that I just had to make this change.

I make these small changes that costs me seconds everywhere, but I only needed 22 seconds to get my goal of 
sub 27 minutes which would have happened if it wasn't for mistakes on map 27+30. With a much more aggressive route,
and just being better at the game (I lose on average 10 seconds to 30nm2939 by Henning on underhalls!) I could 
see 30nm possibly going below 25 minutes with a near perfect run, something with as few mistakes as a UV run below 
20 minutes, which should happen someday. So, perhaps at least 10x or so as hard to get sub 25 nm-speed compared to 
getting sub 20 uv-speed, but possible. 

For now sub 27 minutes should be the next goal, after that I would need to use a better (more aggressive) route.


Map 01: Straightforward map, sometimes you take too much damage which is not good for the next map.
It's usually very easy to get a low 6 second time because monsters attack instead of moving on NM.

Map 02: Hardest map, I feel like 50% of my time is spent on this map alone. Usually I get a time
just above 1:10, the IL record is 44 seconds, so there is potential to save a lot of time here.

Map 03: Good time, everything went fine.

Map 04: A lot of health so I can go pretty fast here.

Map 05: I am horrible at this map, I also pick up some rockets here, though it's not really needed.
I can save 10 seconds on this map if I just rush through it.

Map 06: The start of this map is quite easy and everything goes ok, but then I miss
everything after red key door and I don't even get the exit jump. Got lucky and managed to
get past the spectres without taking too much damage and make the jump second try.

Map 07: While I am likely to die with this kind of health, this map is actually really easy when
I have decent health from 06. I don't have any trouble getting the rocket jump after countless practice attempts.
This map would be really hard\annoying doing it the normal way, as all the arachnotrons needs to be dead,
which is not too easy with -respawn.

Map 08: Time here is usually dependent on how much luck you get in the yellow key room. 
This could have gone better, but not a complete disaster. I don't grab the BFG here,
since I can do well with rockets on map 09, save plasma ammo and grab BFG on the start of map 10.

Map 09: This map went well, I have mega armor left which is nice for map 10.

Map 10: This map used to be quite difficult, but I haven't had much trouble with it recently. 
Most dangerous part is going for the BFG, hopefully a lot of infighting going on. 
I was really low on health so I decided to grab 25 health for map 11.

Map 11: Almost died here, not sure if I should kill the chaingunner at the start
and also if I should use plasma instead of chaingun, lucky to survive.

Map 12: Somehow accidently switched to chaingun instead of BFG. I very recently decided
to use BFG to kill the manc right away, after I died because he came out to block me once.
I suppose that's why Henning does it as well in 30nm2939, because if he stays in place 
it's better to just grab yellow key because you don't wake up the mancubi since
they can shoot through walls at times. I usually don't have trouble with the cacodemons,
I also got some luck with the lift pattern, time could have been better.

Map 13: I used to do SL50 like I do in UV-speed once I go through first teleporter, but then 
sometimes I would get hit by the imp which would give me a speed boost so I fail the jump.
Now I do SR40 and then SL40 which gives me enough speed to make it, but also not too much if I get hit.

The elevator started to go down straight away, amazing, as I always seem to have to wait 3+ seconds.

Map 14: I never fail this map anymore, like I did in my previous exit. Also I don't grab soulsphere,
since it's not needed at all and I don't have to deal with the lost souls.

Map 15: I grab the 400 plasma ammo here, doesn't take too much time and I don't have to deal with the damage floor.

Map 31: I do some wallruns, not sure if it helps preventing taking damage, doesn't really save time.
I use some plasma to clear out hitscanners, so I have no trouble on this map.

Map 16: This map went perfect! I don't grab the invurnability anymore, as it costs time and it's more dangerous!

Map 17: I love it when that arachnotron infights with that 1 shotgunner, happens 50% of the time.
possible to save a lot of time here.

Map 18: Straightforward map, tried to grab as much health as I could.

Map 19: Bad time here, I usually always get 51-52 seconds.

Map 20: So close to dying, I messed up with the pain elemental\chaingunner section.
In the last room I go to the right torch to wake up the revenant so that he goes to the right.
Worked out perfectly as he was not in position to hit me with a rocket.

Map 21: There are 3 groups of monsters that can hit you when you go through the teleporter,
by moving to the corner first and then behind the wall and then into the gap I am able to 
shoot the SSG twice without getting hit! 

Map 22: Dangerous map if you make a single mistake, so I use a very safe strategy here.
I have no idea what's up with the chaingunners behind the red key door, they don't wake up
even if you are right in front of them, kind of like the 2 shotgunners in underhalls.

Map 23: A lot of health here makes the start very comfortable, I make sure to blow up the barrels 
that are in my way, as they can take away a lot of your health easily. I also wake up the arch vile
and take a step back so that I can more easily kill him with the BFG without taking damage from the revenants.

Map 24: I don't do the wallrun here like I do in uv-speed, because if I fail to hit 3 buttons at the
same time I end the run by going straight down into the acid. If I ever go for sub 26 or if it's already
a terrible run I would consider using it. I also messed up with which weapon to use about 3 times on this map
which cost a lot of time, I was afraid I wouldn't have enough plasma to get clear of the demons.

Map 25: Easy map with this kind of health.

Map 26: I died here not too long ago, got hit in the back just as I was about to go through to the exit door.
Made a really dumb mistake this time by grabbing the green armor when I had 99% mega armor left, but it didn't matter.

Map 27: Not quite sure what happened here really, bad movement I guess. Lucky with the arch vile opening the door.

Map 28: I skipped the invurnability last time, almost got me killed, since it only takes 2-3 seconds to pick it up
I figured I'd just grab it rather than dying trying to save 2-3 seconds.
Also not crazy enough to skip megasphere.

Map 29: Almost everything goes well here, plenty of health through all of it.

Map 30: No bad spawns from the IoS this time, however I can deal with a lot of things with the strategy I use here.
Unfortunately I fired a bit too early with the rockets so I failed to do a 1 cycle, 
again that doesn't bother me too much as time would still be above 27 minutes.


So, not done with this category yet, not sure if I will focus more time on improving route or going for sub 27 
without making any changes. I might start doing 30uv again instead for a while, I am quite sure (for like 
the 100th time, so who knows) that my 30uv route is as good as it can get.
