Description:
This run was started about 1-2 hours after I had an absolutely devastating mistake on map 30 
in a previous run, I shot the first rocket about 0.1 seconds to early so I ended up with
a time above 21 minutes. 

I felt I was playing really well before that mistake and I figured I should just continue
and forget about my failed efforts earlier on. And then I got this run so quickly,
if it wasn't for the failed map 30 I would never have gotten this ridiculous time of 20:32.

My goal was to get 20:59 or lower, so I am very happy to get 20:32.


Map 01: I always aim for 6 seconds here, even though I have gotten 5 seconds a few times 
I feel like aiming for 5 seconds decreases my chances of getting through in less than 7 seconds.

Map 02: I reset at 46 seconds and my best time is 37 seconds, so 41 seconds is good.

Map 03: In my route I choose to grab the RL, 100 plasma and soulsphere. 
This cost at most 5 seconds, the RL should save time on map 4, the plasma ammo should save 1-2 seconds
later on with using BFG, and the soulsphere will increase your chances of getting through the 
next maps. Having the RL means you also don't have to pick it up on map 07. Solid time here.

Map 04: I run past the hitscanners in the start and use RL on the imps. Sometimes you can take 
over 200% damage trying to run past them, so several runs end there. Sometimes it's possible
to run past the demon by the exit, didn't happen this time, but still a very good time.

Map 05: I really like this map, if you do everything correctly you can get 26-27 seconds every time, 
though mistakes happen and I got 28, still good though. 

Map 06: Skipping past the elevator is a really easy trick, skipping to the exit is probably
the trick I hate the most in the whole game, even though if you fail this trick it doesn't directly end
your run :) So what I tried to do here was to first skip the trigger that opens the doors, 
then I went through the teleporter and get a certain angle when facing the wall and just SR50 
across to the exit, but I messed up the easy part of getting the right position so I didn't make it.

A time of 1:02 is pretty bad, but it's just a difficult map for me.

Map 07: This map went perfect.

Map 08: Stuck by the barons... again... I've spent a lot of time trying to find some consistent way
to get through here, but after some time I have just accepted that some runs will go really badly here.
I missed the rockets in baron\cyber room so I picked them up in the other room, as i have to wait
for the elevator anyways.

My best time on this map is 22 seconds, 23-24 seconds isn't too hard to get if you get lucky.

Map 09: Almost perfect, best time I've had is 57 seconds.

Map 10: So here is a pretty big change in the route. Been quite some time since I wondered what
that random light texture in the middle of this room was, and I was really surprised when I found
that it opened up the wall to a BFG. At first I wondered if it could be useful to save time,
but I didn't see any use for it besides the demons on map 10... turns out it can save some time on the next maps. 

After picking up the BFG I was kind of in a bad spot since I usually run around on the right side,
but I was able to run around on the left side without taking too much damage. 

Map 11: 35 seconds is really good here since I didn't manage to kill the imps by the exit area 
before I got on the elevator.

Map 12: Missed the yellow key grab trick unfortunately, though I usually never get it anyways 
and it doesn't really cost too much time to go for it. Happy to not get stuck in any of the elevators.

Map 13: Pretty big change here as well, I skip both invurnabilities to save time. 

I kill the arachnotron in the start, because he will block you very often when you don't drag
him further down like when you go for the invurnability. I then BFG the mancubus (it is possible
to skip past the manc without waking him up, but it works only about 50% of the time) and 
I then don't go through the teleporter and instead BFG the revenants. This increases my chances of
getting past significantly even though I lose about 1-2 seconds on it. Even with invurnability 
you can get blocked by them and you'd lose several seconds. 1:09 is not the best time, but better than
what I get from the old route.

Map 14: One day I decided to just BFG the revenant past the first door, and so completely by accident
did I discover how effective it was to kill him with the plasma ball and everything else with the 
secondary BFG attack. This saves time and plasma, my best time on this map is 19 seconds with this method.

Map 15: Yet another use for the BFG, I clear out the cacodemons to save 1 second, but if I
wouldn't have picked up the BFG by now I would pick it up after going through the teleporter. 
But then I would have to wait for the weapon change animation, but since I already have 
the BFG I can fire before I pick it up. This saves time, but also it prevents waking up 
the pain elementals and cacodemons which saves plasma + time :)

Map 31: 34 seconds is good, at least it's not 35.

Map 16: Different approach here, I skip using the BFG to save plasma ammo compared to older runs.
I drag the revenants out and just ignore them, this also usually means I don't get hit by the revenant behind
me since I am almost moving. The imps in the end should not have enough time to kill me anyways so 
I don't BFG them either. Good time here.

Map 17: Just had to miss that skip in yellow key room, oh well, doesn't cost too much time.
In the run I had just before this one I had 1:48, so this could have gone better.

Map 18: Straightforward map, 24 seconds is fine.

Map 19: This map is always very scary, if you don't glide quick enough the run is over.
Luckily I didn't even have to apply any vertical mouse movement here and I just went straight through.
Sometimes I get stuck when strafing to the left, very annoying but thankfully that didn't happen.

Map 20: Usually I always get 37 seconds here, but 38 seconds is fine. Made sure not to run 
too quickly into the teleporter, or else I can get stuck with no chance of escaping.

Map 21: Easiest glide in the game, decent time.

Map 22: Incredible time here, everything went perfect. Whoever attempts to improve
on this run will have a lot of "fun" on this map, because getting something like 27 seconds is 
very very difficult, so happy to get such a time here. 

There are 3 tricks to this map, first there is a glide that can be very random. 
I've spent several hours trying to figure out how to do it quickly, because it's not 
uncommon to just completely end your run right here because you can't get through fast enough.
Then I do a rocket jump, should save 3 seconds if done quickly enough, and last there is a SR50
jump across to the exit area, I use a BFG here to make sure I always get this trick, as it fails
if something blocks you.

Map 23: The barrels stayed up! So I get to do another trick here and run across the barrels saving 
quite a few seconds. I also skip picking up the BFG and just run around the demons.

Map 24: I always get nervous here, a small mistake and it's over. A bit of bad luck with the lost souls and it's over.
Everything went good here, of course my movement could be better though.

Map 25: With this amount of health I expect no trouble here, usual time for me is 45-46 seconds.
I skip the 200 plasma ammo as it saves 5 seconds.

Map 26: I BFG at the start to reach the switch as quickly as possible, so I can get there before the 
cacodemon teleports in. I then wallrun on a lost soul to grab yellow key, sometimes it can fail if you get hit
by cacodemon\imp from behind which gives you a speedboost.

Map 27: Insane, I swear that arch vile could have ended that run if he didn't attack.
I try to avoid bumping into him since it can change his direction and he can walk straight into the teleporter.
Very happy with getting through this map, 22 seconds is fine.

Map 28: I BFG before I enter the room with the arachnotrons, so I don't wake up the mastermind.
I skip the invurnability in the start to save time, can be very risky if you miss with the BFG
and get stuck in there, because the aranchotrons will tear you apart very quickly.

Map 29: Kind of stupid start to the map, where I failed to get the speed boost from walking against the torch.
I took quite a deal of damage in the start, and the cacodemons weren't too friendly. I also
messed up with the BFG a couple of times, but I have so much plasma ammo that it didn't matter.

I then clear everything with 3 BFG's in the second last area, unlucky that 1 shotgunner survived so I had
to use plasma rifle. I then setup for a rocket jump, it took me several hours to find this setup. 
It works really well, but there is still a significant chance that I might fuck it up, in which case
the run is completely over.

Map 30: Just 1-2 hours ago I fucked up big time on this map, naturally I was very nervous thinking:
"You're not going to fuck this up twice in a row are you?". The first spawn that I got was a pain elemental. 
That is very unlucky, still better than an archvile. The lost souls were very distracting, so I wouldn't blame
myself if I missed any rockets, but somehow they all hit.


Final time is 20:32, close to 20 minutes, but I will never be able to find 33 seconds on top of this.
