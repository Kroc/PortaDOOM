E3M8 comparison is not relevant. E3M1-E3M7 time is improved by 1 second.

Description: 
This was done only a few days after I took the episode 1 record, 
from before I had ep2,4 and 30uv,30pl and 30ev records, so it seems
only natural I would eventually improve this one as well. 

However, before I started practicing this I was expecting it to be very difficult.
E3M1 is a really annoying map, though it turned out to be slightly less annoying
than I had first thought. When I looked closely I noticed that E3M2-E3M6 is not too 
hard, I have found ways to get through a lot of monsters consistently. 
There are a few places were you need luck, but obviously you just have to give
it some attempts before it goes your way. And E3M8 either gives me 56 seconds
or I just straight up fail half the time like the exit jump. 

I decided I might as well give it a go, and this is the episode record
I have spent the least amount of time on, and it might be easier to improve
than ep1 and ep2, because the void glide + switch press on ep2 can kill a lot of runs. 
ep4 is probably the easiest to improve, it should be possible without too much 
effort to save another 20 seconds if you know what you are doing :)

So for anyone up for it, I don't think this is too hard to beat if you 
learn how to properly move through these maps and manipulate the monsters. 

My movement was quite bad throughout this demo, but I got the luck that I needed.

Thanks to Kimo Xvirus and those who contributed to the episode 3 route.


E3M1: First of all a time of 30 seconds is beyond incredible for me,
I have never even had 31 seconds! 

There is a trick here where you skip a linedef so that you can grab
the shotgun and get out quickly. I thought you had to have a certain speed
and angle to skip it, which is possible, but I noticed you could actually
run around the linedef itself. This is what both Xit-Vono (e3m1-028) 
and Kimo Xvirus (ep3-0348) did, I just never noticed. This makes the map
a lot less annoying for me. The demons are just pure luck afaik, perhaps
there is some way you can increase your chances of getting past them by 
bumping into them or something, but how many shots it takes to kill them 
is random as long as you can aim down a straight corridor :)

I then practiced the last room quite a bit, usually I just kill 2 imps
before I run into the room and try to get through, as I should usually
survive if I kill 2. Then I just try to kill those who are blocking me 
completely. This didn't take too many attempts so I don't know how well 
it works. This time I just got very lucky compared to usual.


E3M2: I got stuck in that tree in the start, was afraid I'd get 17 seconds,
but the rest was solid so I got 16, which is my best time. Needless to say 
this run is going really well so far.


E3M3: The worst thing that can happen on this map is that you get blocked 
after mega armor. The second worst is to have the spectre block you like that.
In every single practice attempt I have never gotten blocked by him, 
but somehow I started getting blocked a few times in the last runs I did.
This should be easily avoidable, as in it's not luck based. So a really dumb mistake.

Moving through the short maze or whatever after mega armor is quite easy with
the technique I use here, I use strafe on while facing some 45 degree angle 
and just change SR50 direction whenever I bump into the walls instead of turning 
with mouse. I found a really awesome way to deal with the last room as well, 
usually I only have to kill a single imp. The imp always runs away from me
(at least as far as I've seen) and I only need to kill the imp on the left.

I switch to shotgun before I exit.


E3M4: I only grab 1 rocket here, feels like 50\50 if the demon will go
to the right and just let me run straight through, or if he will block the way.
Since I have the shotgun up I can switch the plasma when I pick up the rocket launcher.
Second option is to do like Kimo did and just grab the second rocket and use the RL,
but sometimes a rocket isn't enough to kill him.

I think my best time here is 41 seconds, I make sure to find the correct angle
when I do the keygrab though so with better movement or faster keygrab you can
save a lot of time here, the IL by Hi Jango is 38 seconds for example.

I found a very nice and consistent way to deal with the cacodemon in the exit room, 
it works very often, unfortunately I lost some 2-3 seconds in a different run because
it failed. So it doesn't always work but quite often I just run straight past him like this.


E3M5: Not a good time, lost a second here. Quite an easy map to get 0:35 on.

Thanks to Adam_AK for the blue keygrab setup, works every time so I am always 
able to reach the teleporter as the crusher gives me room to move to it.
Also very easy to get around the spectres like this. 


E3M6: 25 seconds is my best time here, but it's a bit difficult, 
so I am happy with 26 seconds. Needs some luck with the spectre dying 
in a single rocket (which I got this time) and the other rockets as well.


E3M7: Not a good time, though it's not a disaster since I didn't get blocked 
badly by some demons or anything. Usually I get 56 seconds here, my best
time is a low 55, but it's difficult to get in a run. Also the jump in the
end here is often blocked off by lost souls, I don't have any plan to dealing with them.
I can't really stop to kill them because it costs too much time, so I can just
hope that they aren't in my way, which they weren't this time.


E3M8: Only lost 26 seconds to ep3-0348 here... 
Obviously if I was going for best E3M1-E3M8 time I would just grab the BFG on E3M3.
It costs about 3 seconds, I don't think it can be used anywhere in the run to save any time.
So with the BFG this map is straightforward and takes about 8-9 seconds. Kimo got a 31 here.

I still try to put some effort into M8, but that mastermind is scary when I don't really have
enough plasma ammo to take him down, no need to throw away a run for a map that doesn't matter.


Never would I have imagined that I would improve ep3 record because I got 30 seconds on E3M1.
