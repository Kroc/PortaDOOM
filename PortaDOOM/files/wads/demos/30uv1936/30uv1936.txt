Description:
I won't say too much about this run, I'll try to bring it under 19:30.

There's a lot of new stuff compared to 30uv1959, some of those changes
are not too noticable. Some might save at most a second, other just make 
things a bit easier.

One of the bigger changes is map 21, as already shown by eLim in 30uv1951.
The trick was first shown by Looper in his unfinished nomo tas, so some
explanation can be found in the TAS thread on doomworld. This trick can
be very annoying to do as it requires some cooperation with the monsters.
There are monsters all over the place and you cannot get hit by a fireball
when attempting to do the second glide. If you fire then you will only wake 
up more monsters, perhaps a BFG on the closest imps\hell knights might
improve your chances, but you can't waste cells either.

A few other obvious changes on map 10 and 28\29, these were also done by 
Looper when he attempted sub 20, I didn't like those for a few reasons back 
then, but I was wrong. For map 10 you skip the invulnerability and about 120 cells,
this saves about 5 seconds. I figured before that you can save 3 seconds with
those 120 cells by using the BFG somewhere else, and 2 seconds isn't worth it 
because you'll sometimes die to the cyberdemon. But I have done many changes to 
how I use cells so it's no longer an issue, and 5 seconds for the risk of
getting killed by the cyberdemon is a risk you have to take at this point. 
I got lucky this time by him not firing immidately after teleporting.

As for map 28\29, you save 3 seconds by skipping the 600 cells and
invulnerability I figured again you'd save those seconds back with
the additonal cells (even though you grab 400 at map 29), but the 
pain elementals on map 28 don't really get in your way if you just ignore
the cells. You do however need 80 cells to clear the demons. You shouldn't 
lose any time on map 29 if you lack cells either, so it's 3 seconds faster,
but it's a bit more difficult to do than the other way.

Many other differences as well, I might write more about them if I get 
a better time. One of the things I had planned that I didn't do here
is to hit the switch for the elevator\bridge on map 11 from the other side.

Most notable about this run:
Map 04 and 20 matched my best ever time from practice.

Map 12, 21 and 27 were also very good (usually quite luck based).

Biggest timeloss on map 13, had 1:02 on this map just before (which died on map 14).
This was my own fault, fired the rocket too late which didn't push me far enough back.
The yellow key elevator either goes up or down and it costs 3 seconds when it goes up first, 
so that is luck based.

Second biggest timeloss on map 09, not too often that I get blocked by the imps there.
Made a good choice of going back and trying to get down on the left side.

Failed the jump on map 22, costs a few seconds, instant glide was very lucky.

I don't think there were any other major timeloss\mistake, just a lot of smaller things.
On both of the longest maps (17,29) I lost several seconds. Also a lot of bad movement, 
bumped into walls a bit more often than usual.
