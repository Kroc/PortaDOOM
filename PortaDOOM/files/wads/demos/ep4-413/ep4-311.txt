E4M8 comparison is not relevant. E4M1-E4M7 time is improved by 31 seconds.


Description: A very good episode 4 run, I didn't have any big mistake
in my previous run, but I still managed to improve on it by 31 seconds.
E4M5 was quite bad in the previous run, and I also did a small skip
on that map to save time, then I also use more plasma before reaching
the cyberdemon on E4M6 and I got a lot better at E4M1 and E4M2.


E4M1: 29 seconds here would be a really good time for me when I did this 
episode run last time, but I often get 28 seconds or even 27 now so
it could have been even better. This time the map went a bit unusual,
I missed to grab the green armor and I didn't fire a rocket after
grabbing the blue key, but I got lucky and got past anyways.


E4M2: A really good time here, my best time is 22 seconds.
The IL record is 16 seconds, but I need to grab the cells and 
I need to take things a bit safe. A really annoying thing that
can happen on this map is to skip the trigger that opens the 
last door.


E4M3: Very good time, well, I always either get 9 or 10 seconds. 
The rocket jump here isn't too difficult, however I frequently get 
blocked by monsters. Sometimes the lost souls move too far too the 
right or it even dies to my rocket splash damage sometimes. 


E4M4: I always seem to get 39 or 40 seconds on this map, so not
the best time. The IL is 33 seconds done by me, so I know how
to do the map, but it uses the glide and I can't afford to lose
any health to the shotgunners. Losing health and armor will reduce 
my chances of getting through E4M6. Obviously I lost at least a second
here by the imps on the second elevator, might be the biggest mistake
of the run really, even though it isn't that big of a deal :)


E4M5: Very good time here, I think my best time from attempts is
32 seconds, I might have had faster times during practice, not sure.
I need to take things careful in some places, because I can lose a 
lot of time if I fall down in the wrong place.


E4M6: Amazing time here, and this is by far the hardest map in the run.
There are ways to do this map even faster, but you really need to take
care of your health so you can survive the splash damage from the cyber.
If you get really lucky you can have infighting where the cyberdemon
is fighting cacodemons behind him, in which case you can sneak you
and kill him in 2 BFG's. That never really happens, and sometimes he
might just be blocking the entire way and hit you immediately with
a rocket.


E4M7: 43 health is good enough, anything lower and I get a bit
afraid of shotgunners killing me in a single hit or something. 
There's a trick at the end which can sometimes fail if you take
any damage, though invisibility helps a lot. 16 seconds is also
really good for me. 


E4M8: There's some health at the start and I have plenty of 
plasma ammo to deal with all the hitscanners. I skip the red key
so I can try to throw in a nice rocket jump in the end, which worked :)
It's easy to do, but it's really easy to fail it as well if you get 
the wrong angle\position. I don't think too much about it so I'd
say it's 50\50 if I get it or not, but if I fail there shouldn't
be any problem surviving with the health I had.


Now the episode 4 run should be on the same level as the E1,E2 and E3 records.
It's now the shortest run, current E2 record is 3:27, but it is just
around the same difficulty as E1, main reason because of the cyberdemon.
I would say E2 is the easiest to improve right now, if anyone is interested :)
