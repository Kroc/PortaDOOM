E1M8 comparison is not relevant. E1M1-E1M7 time is improved by 7 seconds.

Description: There you have it, proof of the existence of some higher being, 
and turns out whatever that might be really likes doom, because there is no 
way this should have ever made it to the end. There was so much that went 
wrong in this run, but I somehow had just enough health to get through. 

E1M1: It's not difficult to get 12 seconds here, but I can't be bothered 
to reset over something like that on nightmare. Usually I reset if my 
armor drops below 160%, because I'm unlikely to reach E1M3 with enough 
health\armor to make it even worth attempting. 

E1M2: Annoying map due to all the hitscan since again I need to keep
some health\armor for the next map. Straightforward otherwise, not a 
good time though.

E1M3: Very difficult map, not too bad if you have 100\100 at least. 
I was thinking to myself that this is the luckiest run to the blue key
I've ever had, I took almost no damage during some parts which is crazy.
Manage to survive just barely in the end. 55 seconds is a good time for me,
still 2 seconds lost.

E1M4: Very easy map, because I almost never failed the jump to yellow key.
Sometimes I would die at the yellow key door because it didn't open for 
several seconds. Decent time.

E1M5: Demons... I really had enough of them when I did E2 and E3, but at least
that was on the first map. This map is very hard to get a good time on UV, on 
nightmare the yellow key door room is a bit easier, but the rest is a pain.
Should have died a few times on this map. Terrible time.

E1M6: I was 100% sure I would never make it with what I had planned to do here,
as my health was too low. I really didn't even bother practicing a different method 
since I figured it would be a waste of time because it would be impossible to 
get any consistency. I know there is some health nearby and so if I grab it
then at least I would have a chance greater than 0% to make it, then somehow the
shotgunner was perfectly placed under that wall. 

Got lucky again at the blue key area, didn't take too much damage. 
Lucky after yellow key as well, then there is plenty of health, though
I need to keep that for the next map. It's quite easy to rocket yourself 
during the last part of the map. Time is ok.

E1M7: Decent health for this map, could have been better though. I noticed
you could fire a rocket at the imp by the red key, might even be useful in UV.
I expect to save time easily on this map, time could have been even better.

E1M8: I accidently did really well on this map, I had some rockets left and 
the barons even got close to one another. I also did the jump to the exit, 
on nightmare that was something I didn't want to do because spectres will
kill you very very quickly, but I had enough space between them to do so 
this time.
