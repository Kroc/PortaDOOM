Misc. Author Info       : Quite possibly my last major Doom project. I hope
                          to eat my words at a later date. :)

Description             : A 3 episode vanilla megawad for Doom 1 containing
                          a total of 27 maps. Set on one of Jupiter's
                          moons called Ganymede, this wad should provide a
                          challenge for a wide variety of skill levels
                          ranging from the humble newbie to veteran
                          speedrunner. Each episode has it's own
                          progression rather than the usual base ->
                          hellbase -> hell.

                          this point. Thanks!
