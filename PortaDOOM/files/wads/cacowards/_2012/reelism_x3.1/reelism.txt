Description             : A weird, interesting take on the Invasion/Horde modes so popular lately.

			  Each game is divided into five sixty-second rounds. In between rounds,
			  a little slot machine in your HUD rolls, deciding the rules for the
			  next round. Will you be fleeing Barons in low gravity, or running
			  over hobos in a tank? Will you be lobbing petrol bombs at Imps,
			  or taking magical weaponry to creepy neo-furry manchildren? The
			  choice, for once, is not up to you.

			  Expansion One adds a whopping twelve new rules, three new bosses, two
			  maps, co-op play support, and more dogs than strictly necessary.

			  Expansion Two adds nine new reels, five new maps, new gameplay mechanics
			  like Superweapons, terrifying secrets and still even more dogs.

			  Expansion Three adds six new reels, seven new maps, three new bosses,
			  improved modding capabilities and two new modes, including the
			  adrenaline-pumping Boss Rush!

WEAPONS AND ITEMS:
The Evanger SMG's can no longer be selected when ammo is empty, and the dualies will take precedence when auto-switching from an empty gun.
Thrown barrels don't become solid until the player that threw them step away from them, to avoid getting stuck when throwing them straight.
The Explosive Shotgun now has a proper pickup sprite. 

MONSTERS:
Revenants now shoot their missiles a bit higher up, to emulate the original mechanism from Doom II.
Car crashes should now trigger Birthday Explosions during the proper reel.
Crushed monsters no longer create infinite goo.
Sectoid attacks reworked: ~2 sec life, can hurt other aliens, can't hurt bosses but player psionics can.
Whoopsy's vomit will keep spraying out of its mouth instead of magically angling towards the target

BOSSES:
Bosses now become immortal when the player dies in single-play (bosses now get the TID 906 to accommodate this)
Fixed MacGuffin missing some damage resistances.
Fixed a bug where the Wizard would do his sight bark twice.

MAPS:
JRPGVille now has co-op starts and a roomier boss area that's easier for the bigger monsters to path around in.

MISC:
The smoke/effects toggle script will now turn off raindrops (but will not silence the ambient rainfall sounds).
Disabled X/Y Billboarding due to visual glitches on 3D terrain
Completely rebuilt the system for radius-based instakill crushing (tank, JERKs etc.)
