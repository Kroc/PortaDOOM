Description             : You wanted it, now you've got it, a 6 map hub
                          for Strife. Requires a Zdoom compatible source
                          port.
                          
                          A rough story? Well ok. Despite the main threat
                          of the order being defeated, there are many other
                          towns still under their fragmented rule. The
                          front now has the resources to send agents to
                          these outward places and attempt to destroy
                          what's left of the tyranny. You have arrived in
                          the small town of Sweetwater, where what few
                          people survive live a near meaningless life that
                          is under constant threat.

Additional Credits to   : Esselfortium - The music to the map "Void"
                          (map15) is a remix I created of a piece of music
                          of his called "Mobildethvan".
                          Gez - For helping me with Zdoom stuff
                          Xaser - He seems to like my stuff
                          Anyone that has given feedback and played this
                          project or any of my other work over the years.
