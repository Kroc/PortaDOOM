The list of credits at the end of Winter's Fury is hideously outdated, so I've added this one to pick up the slack.
If you think you should be credited and I haven't listed you here, send me a threatening email saying you've kidnapped my family, and I'll be sure to ignore you until you've confirmed that they've died from starvation.

That aside, just tell through email or PM. I'll be around for a little while yet.
