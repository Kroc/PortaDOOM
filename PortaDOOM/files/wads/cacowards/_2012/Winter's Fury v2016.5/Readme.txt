Description             : Winter's Fury
                          
                          This is a 14 map mod for GZDoom, split into 3
                          parts.
                          The maps have rather fast paced action with some
                          scripted sequences and boss fights. If the levels
                          seem a bit difficult, there are 5 different skill
                          levels for you to choose from. The levels are
			  rather short, but hopefully entertaining, if not
                          atmospheric and laggy. 
                          
                          This mod also features replacements for
                          all the weapons, making some faster and others
                          more dangerous. Not only will there be these
                          weapons, there is a whole new set of demons that
                          have taken the "Icy" look.

Additional Credits to   : Maelstrom has been a major help throughout the
                          good 4 years of work. Give yourself a pat on the
                          back. There is a full list of credits in the game
                          after you win and a list included in credits.txt.

Known Bugs              : MAP07B has a strange tendency to crash after a
                          certain amount of time on the level. Be warned. 
                          Also, cheating through levels can screw up an
                          awful lot of scripts. Be careful.
