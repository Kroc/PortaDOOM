Description             : There is a dimension, a dimension full of
                          nonsense and surrealism. It is a place where
                          crates are out to kill you, and a place where
                          logic jumps off a bridge. A journey into a
                          wondrous land of ludicrosity, your next stop:
                          Beyond Reality!
                          
                          This WAD is playable on zdoom, skulltag, and
                          zandronum, OpenGL is recommended to remove
