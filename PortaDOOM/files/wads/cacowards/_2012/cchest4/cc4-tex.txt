Notable changes in version 1.5:
Texture PLAT128B has been removed due to Boom being incompatible with
256-tall textures. Oops! I was unaware of this when I originally compiled
the wad. Affected maps should replace it with PLAT128A.

Textures BRONZEB5, BRONZEB6, BRONZEG5, and BRONZEG6 have been replaced with
significantly improved versions that I made more recently. My old versions
that were there before were rather crappy; hopefully the replacement won't
cause any problems.

Flats HEXA01, HEXA02, and HEXA03 have been replaced with improved versions
that I made more recently. The differences between these and the old ones
shouldn't be significant enough to cause any problems.

Notable changes in version 1.6:
Replaced SKY2 with an improved sky created by esselfortium. Have fun! -TGH!

Notable changes in version 1.7:
Added updated versions of BRICKPL3, MIDVINEA-D, SKY3, and STONE2B1-3 that
were made by esselfortium for 32in24-11.  I also added mirror versions of
MIDVINEA, MIDVINED, and MIDVINEG (MIDVINEH-J, respectively), corrected an
issue with the SW#DIRT textures present since the release of Doom, and
added a BRICKPL texture (BRICKPLA) that wasn't originally present but
which I added to one level.

It also includes custom TRANMAP lumps by esselfortium used for translucent
linedefs in some levels; you can set such a linedef as 82% (TRANS82), 65%
(TRANS65), 35% (TRANS35), and 18% (TRANS18) translucent, /or/ you can give
one additive blending (TRANSADD), which is useful for forcefields.

This version is the basis for the resources in the final release of
Community Chest 4.  Enjoy! -TGH!
