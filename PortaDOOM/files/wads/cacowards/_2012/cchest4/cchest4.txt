Archive maintainer      : This is a hotfix which corrects a bug in MAP17
                          that prevented 100% Kills, as well as a bug in
                          MAP29 that could prevent it in coop multiplayer
                          and a bug in MAP18 that could get you trapped.
                          A list of the changes made in this hotfix and the
                          second release can be seen in changes.txt.

Description             : The fourth installment of the series, Community
                          Chest 4 boasts 32 maps made by 20 different
                          authors from the Doom community.  After four
                          years of work, they have been made available for
                          your enjoyment.
                          
                          Included in this package is the base resource WAD
                          compiled for the project, which can be found in
                          cc4-tex.zip.  It may be a good starting point if
                          you need a large, varied, and meticulously
                          organized texture WAD for your project!

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Four years
Editor(s) used          : Too many to list
Known Bugs              : As of this writing, parts of MAP14 will not be
                          rendered correctly when played in certain ports,
                          such as GLBoom+ and Risen3D.  This is because of
                          the use of the Mordeth bridge effect, which is
                          currently not supported by most hardware
                          renderers.
                          
                          On MAP18, crossing the bridge north of you will
                          cause any monsters beneath it to be teleported on
                          top of it.  This is a limitation of the bridge
                          effect used in that area and there is nothing
                          that can be done about it without crippling
                          monster movement.
                          
                          On MAP20, in PrBoom+, dots can occasionally be
                          seen floating in the air above the curving lasers
                          later on in the level.  The cause of this bug is
                          unknown to the compiler as of this writing.
                          
                          In addition, although this isn't a bug, it
                          should be noted that one level requires the death
                          of the player to exit, so if your source port
                          does not allow dead players to exit by default,
                          you must turn this function on (if such an option
                          exists).  The OPTIONS lump included in this WAD
                          serves to force this option on in the Eternity
                          Engine, so you won't need to turn it on every
                          time you play.
May Not Run With...     : Doom2.exe, Boom.exe (too many SEGS on certain
                          levels), or any source port that isn't
                          Boom-compatible
