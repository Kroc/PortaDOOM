Changelog for Community Chest 4
Second Release +
-------------------------------

(Changes from the original Second Release are marked with a +.)

MAP05: Installation Decrepit -
* Fixed a nodebuilding error in a secret room.
* The exit is now more clearly marked.

MAP07: Hoedown -
* Added some more ammo early in the level due to player complaints.
* Added a new secret area which allows the chaingunners northeast of the nukage
  river to be quickly dispatched without the use of free look.
* Fixed an error with a sector next to the secret elevator erroneously being
  given the same tag.

MAP11: The Grotto -
* You can no longer block progress by outrunning the lowering floor in the
  yellow skull section.
* Fixed the teleporter in the yellow keycard section, whose southern side was
  facing the wrong direction.

MAP13: Viral Implant -
* Corrected the name entry in ZMAPINFO; it should now have the correct title in
  recent versions of ZDoom.
* The secret crushers no longer have stopping triggers. This is because the
  door-opening mechanism that was implemented in case the crushers were stopped
  low to the floor worked completely differently in different source ports, and
  no other linedef action in existence works on a crusher sector even when it's
  stopped.  Time your jump well or you will be crushed.

MAP17: Metastasize -
+ Previously, one monster was trapped outside the level because his teleporter
  line had the wrong tag assigned. This has been fixed, so 100% Kills is now
  possible.

MAP18: Suburbia -
* The spider mastermind was immobilized, unable to attack, because for whatever
  reason, Jimmy flagged the white road marks as Block Monster when he put them
  underneath it. This flag has been removed from every road mark in the level.
* Fixed an incorrect floor texture in the room with the jeep.
+ You can no longer jump out of the windows near the berserk pack pedestal and
  trap yourself.

MAP20: Interstellar Sickness -
* Removed black sections of the sky, which were visible only if you looked
  straight up in a source port with a hardware renderer.
* Fixed blatant unknown textures that occurred in PrBoom+ and the Eternity
  Engine, but not in ZDoom-based source ports, which would explain why
  absolutely nobody reported them when the WAD was originally released.

MAP21: Shaman's Device -
* Fixed an alignment error with the bars alongside the first crusher hallway.
* The textures on the barriers for the top-secret medikits now move when the
  barriers do, and the armor bonuses no longer teleport on top of them when
  they're activated.

MAP23: Melting Universe II -
* Fixed a flat bleeding outside its sector, a wall texture bleeding into the
  floor, and a horribly misaligned texture, all of which were errors made by the
  nodebuilder previously used. (Don't you just hate it when that happens?)
* Fixed a missing texture and an incorrect one among the grid of lights in the
  curving hallway.

MAP24: Detachment -
* Fixed a fence texture bleeding through the floor at the entrance into the
  building.
* Removed unnecessary sectors (i.e. zero-height sectors that can be removed
  without affecting the level's appearance).

MAP25: Nightmare Complex -
* The final switch can now be activated more than once.  This is in case the
  player is unlucky enough for the pillar-raising trigger to not go off before
  they activate said switch.

MAP29: Spiritual Holocaust -
* You can now achieve 100% Items without the use of an exploit.
* You can no longer block any monsters outside the level from teleporting in,
  and prevent 100% Kills.
+ The above is now true for coop as well; two linedefs with erroneous types
  assigned have been fixed, preventing the first teleporting monster from being
  blocked in coop.
