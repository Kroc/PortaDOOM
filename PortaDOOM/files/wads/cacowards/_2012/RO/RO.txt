IZ NOTHING HERE!!..

Now seriously, if you are looking for credits - everything you want to know
is added to decorate files inside the mod to each corresponding thing.
In my opinion, more convienient than digging through credit file for single graphic
or sound you are looking for in certain weapon or anything else!

If you plan to use stuff from the mod, I guess it's okay to be grabbed.
Being asked for permission is a very nice courtesy, but it's not mandatory.
Just remember to give credit where's needed.
