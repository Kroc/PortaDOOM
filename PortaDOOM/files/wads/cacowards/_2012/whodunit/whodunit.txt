Description             : Lies. Deception. Murder.
                          
                          "Who is the murderer? Some never find out, if he
                          is cunning enough to elude them for long enough.
                          He is normal just like the rest of us, if not a
                          little bit too normal. He is you, and he is me.
                          He is inside the walls, and he is waiting.
                          
                          Even more interesting is this: If the
                          "murderer" simply blends in and waits, keeping
                          his knife hidden and watching as the innocents
                          off each other one by one, is he still the
                          monster? Sometimes the "innocents" kill more
                          than the "murderer" does. So who is sane?
                          
                          Don't think about it too long, or you'll become
                          distracted enough for him (or me, or that other
                          guy) to sneak up behind you. Good luck."
                          -WhiteRabbit on "WhoDunIt"
                          
                          WhoDunIt is a custom gamemode for Zandronum that
                          rewards the observant, and punishes the clumsy.
                          
                          The game starts with all the players spawning in
                          various locales, armed with little but their
                          fists and an array of melee weapons scattered
                          around the levels.
                          After a short while, one player is chosen as the
                          Murderer. The Murderer's goal is simple: Murder
                          everyone. His preferred method to deliver death?
                          A sliver of metal between the vertebrae.
                          
                          The Murderer has to be cautious, though! For
                          while the knife is the most efficient and
                          satisfying method of taking out others, drawing
                          it is very loud and visually obvious; Marking him
                          as the largest threat in the room, usually ending
                          with him in a corner getting his skull bashed in
                          by 'The Innocents'.
                          
                          To make matters worse, all these deaths have left
                          the Murderer with a constantly draining sanity,
                          eventually losing it and committing suicide when
                          unable to watch something squirm and die.
                          
                          Fortunately, the trademarked knife he carries
                          isn't the only weapon at his disposal; Poisonous
                          chlorine gas, remote cameras, smoke bombs,
                          poisoned first-aid kits, and even Automated
                          trip-wire shotguns allow The Murderer to
                          manipulate and destroy his prey.
                          
                          But what happens when The Murderer blends in a
                          little too well? What happens if somebody loses
                          it and kills someone completely innocent?
                          Two mistakes. That's all you get before you are
                          removed from the game instantly. After an
                          Innocent kills one Innocent, he is marked with a
                          Yellow Aura, enabling other players to beat him
                          to within an inch of his life before being
                          allowed to venture with the others.
                          Another mistake? You won't be heard from
                          again...

                          Worse still, The Murderer has a penchant for
                          being able to find the careless, regardless of
                          their location.

Known Bugs              : There are likely a few map-related bugs or some
                          odd things here or there because of Zandronum's
                          net code and ACS behaving strangely at times, but
                          it shouldn't cause anything to utterly break;
                          that being said, stability cannot be guaranteed
                          but the authors have done their best to make the
                          experience as bug-free as possible
May Not Run With...     : Any source port other than Zandronum

Additional Notes:

SERVER RUNNERS -- The scripts included for the game mode automatically set
server options to optimal settings in order for the game mode to work
as intended. However, there are some cvars that can be set on the server
end for a bit of control, and they are as follows:

wdi_blacklist_rounds <amount> -- Sets the number of rounds ex-murderers
                                 cannot be the murderer for. (Default: 5)
wdi_murd_healthbonus <amount> -- Sets the extra maximum health the murderer
                                 gets per player. (Default is 10)
wdi_murd_maxbonus <amount> -- Sets the MAXIMUM health murderer can have.
                              (So if you don't want him to have 400 health
                              in a 32 player game, use this)
                              (Default: 0/unlimited)
wdi_safety_time <time> -- Sets the time, in seconds, that players have to
                          setup before the murderer is chosen.(Default: 30)

PLAYERS -- There are help graphics that can be shown if you press F1 while
in game. However, due to an issue with Zandronum, only the first of four
pages will show up, which just has general play info. If this is the case,
start the game in single player, where all F1 pages should properly show.
There is also a cvar that can be used, but A MAJOR WARNING: It has been
reported to cause extreme performance problems when used, especially on
lower-end machines. Use at your own risk. The cvar is:

wdi_filmgrain_level <level> -- (CLIENT) Sets the type of film grain to use.
                               0: Off, 1: Coarse, 2: Fine. (Default: 0)

Disable it if you begin to experience problems with it on. It will enable
a cinematic-esque film grain effect.

ABOUT WDI04: "CONFINEMENT" A.K.A. "WHY DOES THIS LOOK REALLY FAMILIAR? - 
Yes, WDI04 "Confinement" is a modification of map32 from Hellcore
(hc092604.wad, 2004 Cacoward Recipient). Permission had been obtained
from the authors of the map for use in this project with modifications
to suit the gameplay needs and flush it out a bit.

Some other tips and things to note:

*If the game is really dark, try upping your brightness in the options
menu. The maps were designed to be mostly dark and gloomy, but not to a
degree where they wouldn't be fun to play on. As such, if visibility
is a problem, turning up the brightness a notch or two should help.

*OpenGL mode is practically required to play this mod to it's fullest
extent. While 3D Floors have made their way into the software renderer
at long last, this mod relies very heavily on dynamic lighting as well,
with several maps consisting of almost nothing but dynamic lights to
provide illumination. There are also a few items that utilize dynamic
lights for their primary function. Therefore, without OpenGL mode, the
already dark maps may become impossibly dark for players who do not use
OpenGL.

*Be sure to bind the new controls in the options menu. These will allow
you to quickly use medkits when needed, or use particular murderer items.
However, every item in the inventory is accessible by the normal inventory
selection means, if one were to opt for that instead. Below is provided
an alias which will ease with inventory selection: simply hold the 'q'
key and the mouse wheel will select inventory items. Release to have it
select weapons again. Modify it as seen fit.

The alias:
bind q "+invselect"
alias +invselect "bind mwheelup invnext;bind mwheeldown invprev"
alias -invselect "bind mwheelup weapnext;bind mwheeldown weapprev"

*THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH BOTS! Well, it will work, but it'll often bug
out because Zandronum's ACS treats bots a special way or something.
In either case, the bots won't react or do anything in survival mode
other than blindly run around, so it won't be much fun. Needless to say
with that, this mod is intended for online multiplayer only.
