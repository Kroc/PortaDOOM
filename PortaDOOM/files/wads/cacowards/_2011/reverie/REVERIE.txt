*Wad description/History*

IMPORTANT: Don't read the story if you don't want the plot spoiled.

-=The Story=-

The story of Reverie revolves around the doomguy (the player) who, as it reveals in the
end, dreamed up the entire plot. There was never an outbreak of hell on the Earth.
Everything about the impossible that occurs within this universe is revealed to be a
dream. The real marine lost control of his vehicle and crashed upon driving home, of
which knocked him into a deep sleep. Upon waking up, he finds comfort in the fact that
none of those disasters had happened. It's as if the player is fighting their way
through a coma in order to bring consciousness back to their true self. The reward is
the release of all the worries surrounding the end of the world in the dream that is
Reverie. After all, Reverie itself was based on a real dream, of which spawned the
original idea for the last three levels (MAP28-30). So I hope everyone else can enjoy
the beauty of this dream in the same way I did (with a nice classic 90's vibe).

Levels:

MAP01: Stratos Gate
Build Time: 3 hours
Entryway style obviously, I tried to avoid any sort of style imitations or remakes, but
this one sort of slipped through for lack of a better MAP01 start. The original MAP01
was going more for a Plutonia-style start up, of which was later removed and placed in
the MAP25 slot of Doom Core. So yes, I would probably be guilty for this one in terms of
style imitation (somewhat). I was going to sketch out MAP01 candidates in my sketchbook
one afternoon, this was the first map I sketched out to be an entryway style opener much
like TNT MAP01 (only much closer to entryway than I probably should have gone). I liked
the way it looked so much I decided to try and make it that night and it came out within
3 hours. There was a time I thought about replacing it, but after awhile I realize the
only reason I would have wanted to replace it was that people would suspect it was too
close to the entryway style. I agree, it probably is, but I like it enough to leave it
there as it is, as I've grown accustomed to it as the opening of Reverie.

MAP02: Soldier's Stand
Build Time: 2 days
I guess mostly Christen Klie comes to mind for this one, with some slight influences for
some interesting inter-connected areas. A little tech base level built into the side of
a mountain. Didn't take long to make, it was a nice little mapping session of mine.

MAP03: The Cup Of Wrath
Build Time: 3 days
Structurally speaking, I was inspired by Cleimos 2 after viewing the maps numerous times
in XWE (without the grid). So I had seen the structue of this map in my head before I
ever had an idea of what it was actually going to look like. It's an interesting way to
improvise when approaching the territory of level design. Some might think it takes
inspiration from MAP03 of Doom II 'The Gantlet' due to the use of starport and metal
textures, but this level really doesn't hold much inspiration from that level.

MAP04: Divine Judgement
Build Time: Unsure - around 5 or 6 days
Personally, I don't think I've studied Jens Nielsen's designs closely enough to put out
a map that could be confused for his creations, but the intent was at least to get a
different enough map that it would seem to have come from someone else. Which was
certainly a focus of mine when working on this megawad. If I was going to do it alone,
I was at least going to pretend I was multiple different authors making different maps
enough to give a good taste of variety. I can't say as to whether I've accomplished this
or not. I was between completing this and MAP20 at the time of working on this. I
remember being in a motel room in San Simeon viewing the two of them while the Sixth
Sense was playing on TV - good memories. :)

MAP05: Substance
Build Time: A handful of hours, made within a day.
Orin Flaharty comes to mind, though slightly with few given techniques (overhanging
poles, some solid looking areas, the use of nook and crannies to house candles). Some
slight Jens Nielsen ideas were also tossed in for added measure (narrow staircase with
torches). The last room texture choice is a bit "Circle of Death" or maybe "Hell's
Kitchen" given the author influence. Though the author himself (Orin Flaharty) was John
Romero influenced - gives an odd hybrid of influence. A little bit of American McGee
influence as well, given the use of the BROWNHUG texture surrounding the grass flats.
It's an odd quirk but I like the old 90's vibe it gives.

MAP06: Sledgehammer
Build Time: 4-5 days
You may have noticed the full automap structure looks much like a sledgehammer itself.
This was done on purpose much like MAP03, as some maps weren't so much influenced in
category of texture choice or architecture, but sometimes automap structure inspiration
can call for some interesting results. It's a fun thing to experiment with, I really
just imagined a MAP06 slot would look something like the way it came out. It was also
originally more difficult, relying on some puzzles to figure out how to solve the level,
but I was rebuked by the playtesters to make it easier, so I did.

MAP07: Lazarus
Build Time: A handful of hours
Another one made within a day, had the picture of this map in my head for awhile before
finally stepping up and mapping the whole thing out. It was so much fun in the early
days of Reverie's developement, as most of the maps at the time were made within a day.
Amazing times.

MAP08: Triplet II
Build Time: A week or so
An unofficial sequel to Jim Flynn's episode replacement for Doom II: Enigma. Even though
it was actually 9 levels it is definitely one of my favorite episodes ever made for Doom
II (besides Dystopia 3). I am also a big fan of Jim Flynn's work, as he had a tendancy
of making epic-sized maps with incredible innovations and ideas that made you feel
overwhelmed in amazement. I tried to go for that here, not so much in the Jim Flynn
style, but with a mix of my own ideas. I'm sorry to say that I could not conquer the
savegame buffer of this level; you could always save it at the exit of MAP07 in any
vanilla doom port.

MAP09: Fracture
Build Time: 2 days
Inspired by Sverre Kvernmo's Derelict Station (CABAL2.ZIP) A smallish base with plenty
of action to be had, while being somewhat fractured. The furious "ending" of this level
was also inspired by the constant traps that occurred at the end of CABAL6 (Eye of the
Storm) by Sverre Kvernmo. This was probably another one of those maps that I had doubts
about at first when I started woring on it, but sometimes you have to push your way
through those doubts and just make a fun level. I recall listening to King Crimson while
working on this level, I reckon the song "Fracture" gave me the idea for the title, as
it seemed fitting.

MAP10: The Tech Towers
Build Time: 5-6 days
Another Enigma-inspired map; with a hint of Memento Mori II (Corporate Hell). Hope you
guys don't get too lost in this one, as it can prove to frustrate some people not
knowing where to go; I recommend following that red arrow in the beginning, though
you're free to be as lost as you like in this monster, if that's your thing. I think
most of all I thought about that level in Enigma titled "The Tower" as that was also
somewhat of a beast to navigate, but I really love getting lost in all it's creation. I
wanted to make an epic-sized level slightly inspired from such an idea, as it consists
of many buildings to navigate, but with a little more direction on where to go thanks to
the dogging of the doomworld community.

MAP11: Hello, Cybie!
Build Time: 2-3 days
Another map purposely structured to look odd yet creative. Definitely another of the
Christen Klie inspired maps, more specifically Subspace from The Master Levels, only
much more difficult. If you look at the automap structure of Subspace from the Master
Levels then you should be able to spot the influence it had on this map. Be careful upon
the exit of this map, as it is a death exit and hitting a button during this sequence
you may accidentally restart the level.

MAP12: Armageddon valley
Build Time: Most likely a few days.
Just a little rocky earth level to get the next episode started up. It takes you back to
pistol start (I'm sorry) because of your teleporting to a starship when escaping from
MAP11. However, the ship crashes at some point, and you've lost all your weaponry again,
so you've got to fight your way through to earn your weapons back. A bit inspired from
The Waterway by Orin Flaharty, somewhat Cleimos 2 as well. There are some really tricky
secrets in this level so keep your eyes open.

MP13: Stronghold Earth
Build Time: 3-5 days
Another big map to be explored, with some rockies and some buildings. Inspiration comes
mostly from Fortress of Death by Andrew Harvey. I thought the exit idea was hilarious,
seeing the boat and paddles right there waiting for you. As if you were on some quick
getaway from hell and you're yelling to yourself, "ROW!!! ROW!!!" I really enjoyed
making this map, it's pretty big and I like running around the place. It's all in good
fun.

MAP14: Tyranny
Build Time: Probably 3 days
Another map built to look that way structurally on purpose. It's an interesting practice
to make with what you have according to the shapes of sectors and such. It makes the
maps look so pretty. Some Icarus inspirations, with Christen Klie (again) for some
interesting quircks. The idea in this one is sort of starting from scratch (outside the
fortress) then working your way through security (the bridge) then eventually usurping
the fortress itself. The arch-vile could be seen as the ruler of this place, sitting on
his throne the way he is. It feels good to feel like you're conquering enemy territory
and you've accomplished yet another mission along the way.

MAP15: Blade Runner
Build Time: Weeks
Another city map inspired from Industrial Zone, Corporate Hell and Karmacoma. Also
contains a homage to another of Christen Klie's creations (The Catwalk). If you're
extra tricky you'll find the secret exit, which isn't easy to find as it relies upon
secret searching in this level. This also suffers from savegame buffer, so be sure to
save at the exit of MAP14 if you're into that.

MAP16: Dark Zone
Build Time: A handful of hours
I made that first area at night then mapped the rest out the following day. I've had
this idea for the longest time and I'm glad to have finally mapped it out. It was a good
stretch for my mind to work out. That one area you teleport to with the highway street
and the street lights with a mountain view is inspired from a real place I used to visit
quite often. In Long Beach, there's this El Dorado Park area where people like to fly
their remote control airplanes. I used to bike ride there every afternoon (about 1 PM)
and watch them fly their planes. Sometimes I would ride there in the late evening of a
clear day, so you could see the mountains at sunset. This area I made looks somewhat
similar to such an area.

MAP17: Fatality
Build Time: 2-3 days
Took awhile to settle for some ideas surrounding the MAP17 slot. Some slight "The Five"
influence with the starting area, followed by some mixed styles of Orin and Jens yet
again, as they were both very creative. It was also slightly inspired by The Shaft from
Memento Mori II, having a series of miniature battle fields to take out before
continueing the actual level.

MAP18: Sleeping Spirits
Build Time: 4-5 days
Obviously this one draws from Blessed Are The Quick (Icarus) with some minor hints and
influences from The Mansion (PSX Doom). Had to try and make an animated rain texture,
of which ended up looking exactly like the one in Icarus (whoops!) Named Sleeping
Spirits because of the ghosts that wake upon gunfire. Keep an eye out for the television
set, you can turn it on/off via a remote control laying on the bed of a bedroom.

MAP19: Dusk Town
Build Time: Made within a day (mostly).
Somehow reminds me of Plutonia; I guess it's the earth feel that naturally lumps it in
the Plutonia category. Anyway, I started this map one morning but a car ride took the
whole day away from me, so the following day I picked up from where I was and completed
it. Can be quite a nasty map so watch out.

MAP20: One Such Reverie
Build Time: A long time!
I was constantly thrown away from this map, due to having to pursue other ideas I had
that had to be made (MAP01/MAP04 for example) but eventually I came back and completed
this map. I made the starting area and the following area in a handful of hours, but I
wasn't really sure where to take the map. So I felt making an interconnecting map with
teleporters would be a good way to go. Even though I already had that in mind for
something else entirely (see Triplet II).

MAP21: Sunrise
Build Time: Probably 2 hours.
A smallish map intended for survival. Made within a movie's length (Princess Mononoke -
on a random trivial note). It used to be strictly that first arean you teleport to but
I'm glad to have expanded it the way I did over time.

MAP22: Egyptian Plains
Build Time: 2-3 days
Another Cleimos 2-inspired map, using those CLEGYPTA-D textures. I do like how it turned
out, though ironically I really like how that sewer area turned out. Someone thought it
was Epic 2 inspired but it actually isn't as I hadn't played that megawad until long
after I had completed this level.

MAP23: Cyclone Rider
Build Time: 4-6 days
Had to make that first area as I was inspired by the design of MAP26 of Memento Mori
(Between Scattered Corpses). It had four spider masterminds and a cyberdemon at the
begging and yet it managed not to be too overwhelming. Following this is the level
itself, which puts the good old Doom 64 textures to use, with some further style mixing
structurally speaking. I used some of the Doom 64 textures because the most I can do
with texturing is either remixing existing stock Doom II textures or just taking a
picture of something outside and making that a texture. I felt there was sort of a lack
of new textures, in other words, that I thought Doom 64's textures would be interesting
and fun to use for such an occasion.

MAP24: Sewer System (Arch Vile's Den)
Build Time: 3-4 days
I think MAP24, 25 & 26 were the toughest to come up with. They were just three empty
slots that needed to be filled to complete this megawad, and I wasn't about to stop.
After a long while, I finally stepped up to make a sewer-themed level. Not much
background surrounds it other than the idea that it would originally be populated by
arch-viles (hence the subtitle "Arch Vile's Den").

MAP25: Sever Tomorrow
Build Time: 2-3 days
I tried hard to find inspirations for these last three levels, even going as far as
searching up old N64 classics on YouTube. Originally, I had a couple ideas for this
map. It would either be inspired by the cruiser ship from Go For Broke (Bomberman 64)
or possibly Mizer's Palace (Jet Force Gemini). I ended up going with something else
completely; something that at first was inspired by Last Call from Final Doom, with a
mix of Super Mario 64 thrown in there (the western areas, mostly inspired from inside
the Pyramid of Super Mario 64). This is another map that can be difficult if you don't
take your time with the monsters of the map. This was also the very last map I made for
this megawad so you can imagine how excited I was to complete it.

MAP26: Fallen Angel
Build Time: 2-3 days
Sort of a mix between the inspired structure of MAP25 of Cleimos 2 (Well of Fire) but
with the style of play for something like Not That Simple (Memento Mori). A smallish,
violent level without any worry of savegame buffers. Plenty of monsters to fight when
navigating to and fro certain areas of the map.

MAP27: Godspeed!
Build Time: 3-4 days
When I first got Plutonia Revisited I had to get a sneak peak of each level before
actually playing the megawad. When I reached MAP24 (Terra Incognita by 4mer) I knew
right away I was looking forward to playing that level, and I knew right away I wanted
to make a Living End style level that is as free-going as it looks. I've decided to
avoid the use of damaging floors surrounding the entire level as I would like to
encourage further exploration as well as breaking away from the age-old tradition of
Living End-type levels.

MAP28: Turbine Accelerator
Build Time: 3 days
Inspired from the bigger Casali maps (Pharoah, Caribbean, The Sewers, Odyssey Of Noises)
only this is more of a metal-themed tech map. With an outdoor area and a waterway near
the end. This was one of the earliest map ideas I had for this megawad (of which would
originally have been a 3-level PWAD) along with MAP29 and MAP30. Reverie was based on a
reverie of sorts, with MAP29 & 30 following closely by.

MAP29: Salvation
Build Time: Some hours
I really intended this level to be sort of an arena-type battle. This was actually based
on a dream I had, with MAP28 & 30 following as part of my vision for this project. It
really is amazing what you can do to make dreams come true. Also made within a day.

MAP30: Final Doom
Build Time: 3 days
This last level incorporates everything I wanted Reverie to be; beautiful and action-
packed, with a slight hint of nostalgic goodness. There are plenty megawads out there
already that go for the hellish ending, with crazy blood caves and torture chambers. I
wanted Reverie to have a beautiful ending with an atmosphere of hope for survival. It
really puts a good feeling in your heart to know you've saved the world once again from
these hellish monsters. Even if it's just a dream, of which, realistically so, could be
associated with the idea of video games in general. We all like to feel like a hero from
time to time; this is just the way video games should be.

MAP31: Metal Mansion
Build Time: 4-5 days
Something inspired from Excalibur (Eternal Doom) because I was really attracted to the
idea of a puzzle map that relies upon secret searching. It gives the option to quit and
take the normal exit if you're too exhausted by the subtle hints of progression found
throughout the level. Otherwise, if you're extra clever, you'll discover all the secrets
in order to reach the super secret level.

MAP32: Deadlock
Build Time: 3-4 days
Just a smallish map that plays violently. Another of which takes inspiration from the
secret levels that were rather small in size (Requeim MAP32, Icarus MAP32, Cleimos 2
MAP32). I was tempted to replace this one at one point, since it seems there isn't too
much special about this super secret level, but I couldn't bring myself to remove a map
that I enjoyed. Hope you guys can manage well with this one.

A big thanks to PRIMEVAL, James Paddock & stewboy for the new music.

Another great big thank-you to all the playtesters, MegaDoomer, hawkwind, waverider, kmxexii, Ryathaen, Joshy and ArmouredBlood.
