Misc. Author Info       : Makes maps for Doom
Description             : 12 Boom format levels for PrBoom+, ZDoom, or Eternity.  A
			  bonus 13th level is included for laughs.  Inspired by Speed
			  of Doom, Scythe 2, Alien Vendetta, and Plutonia.

			  Originally Vanguard was intended to be a 32-level speedmapped
			  megawad inspired by Speed of Doom's development cycle and 
			  Scythe 2's episodic structure.
