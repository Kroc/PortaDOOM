Description             : A vanilla megawad for Doom 2 containing 32 short,
                          chaotic and challenging maps. The wad's premise
                          was to create at least one speedmap a day. There
                          was no set time limit, times ranged from 1.5 to
                          3.5 hours. Don't let the word "speedmap" scare
                          you off though! In the author's opinion, this
                          wad contains many of his best maps to date.
                          
Additional Credits to   : Snakes and Tango, for making Maps 31 and 32
                          respectively, dsm for creating the titlepic, the
                          Doom iwads and Strife for music and finally the 
			  people who played the maps and gave feedback on 
			  the forums. You know who you are! :D
