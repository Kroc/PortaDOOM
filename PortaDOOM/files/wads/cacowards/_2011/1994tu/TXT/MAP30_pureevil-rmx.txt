Description             : third remake for the 1994 tune-up project, this
			  time revamping a great classic: pureevil.wad

			  Main modifications of map is style, from techbase
			  to the remains of a hellish fortress, and thanks to
			  traversd now the level as been eviscaretd from
			  the original layout i was worked originally, but
			  some echoes of the map still keep in the map, only
			  much more improved...

Story			: This was a peaceful land, in a time looks like
			  a eternity in hell, but it was passed only 17 years
			  from the first invasion in this base...

			  Sure the time make drastic changes at this place,
			  you just remember it in your mind it was another
			  little outpost on phobos of UAC, a oasis for every
			  space marine. But now the demons turned it in
			  their fortress, and the sign of their cruelty is
			  visible at every corner of this place...

			  And it's not only this, you fell something evil...
			  You fell the pure evil itself,and you know it's
			  watching every step you make from the begining of
			  your mission. And you known that's THE REAL ONE,
			  the mother of every battle you fought in all this
			  years...

			  It's time to reclaim back what do you expect...
