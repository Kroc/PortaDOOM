Misc. Author Info       : I love spamming stupid videos on zdoom forums.
			  I build doom maps just for fun...

Description             : My own remake of Nefarious Chateau, a 1994 map
			  by Denver J. Curtis, good detailing, 16000
			  linedefs, fully works on prboom.

			  EDIT: Fixed few bugs noticed from travers dunne,
			  added few more details and improved a little the
			  void/hell red skull key castle traps, enjoy!

Story			: You was invinted at valley of the king for the
			  reustaration of the well knowed "Nefarious Cha_
			  teau", a place invaded by demons and ghosts 15
			  years ago, and people still have memory of the
			  horror. Strange, end of works happens in the
			  same day of the first invasion... bad stuff.

			  And, as usual, somenthing gone wrong.
			  You just arrived at the castle and you heard
			  about the king and queen death, other people
			  become zombies or wicked demons, so the command
			  control decide to clean the invasion one time
			  at all from the source. Is time to figth again
			  for the safety of the hummankind, so grab your
			  guns and your red bull can, and GET READY TO 
			  RUMBLE!
