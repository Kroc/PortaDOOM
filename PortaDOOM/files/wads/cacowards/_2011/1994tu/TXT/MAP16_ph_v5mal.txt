Title                   : INFINITY PLUS
Filename                : ph_v5mal.wad
Release date            : 
Author                  : Malinku and James "Phobus" Cresswell
Email Address           : james@mpcressy.com (Phobus)

Description             : My reworking of Malinku's reworking of the original Vampire 5, for the 1994 Tune Up Challenge project on Doomworld. I stepped in last minute to finish this map, as it was reaching release time and this had been left undone. Intended for the MAP11 slot, as suggested. The name is based on the previous text files description, whilst the music is a homage to the original title and intentions of the original author, Darrel Bircsak, as from what I gather, Castlevania Dracula X is the 5th castlevania (vampire hunter) game. Bloody Tears being stage 3 was kind of cute too, as this is the third "stage" of this maps "evolution".
