Other Files By Author   : This is my first released map
Misc. Author Info       : Brand new to Doom mapping, but been a fan of PSX Doom since 1995. Had to learn A LOT about ZDoom, Boom, Doom Builder etc in a very                           short space of time... AAARGH!

Description             : A revision of David Damerell's Ultimate Doom map, WOODHAL2, which was originally released in 1994. The original map has been                           	heavily revised to bring it up to today's standards in terms of challenge, aesthetics and overall Doominess. This file has been                           	converted from Doom to Doom 2 and runs in Boom and ZDoom. It is unlikely the file will work with vanilla. In terms of file size, 				Woodhalls 2010 is nearly 10 times bigger than the original wad.

Additional Credits to   : The creator of Doom Builder; JaundiceJaun for his excellent, if noisy, Youtube tutorials; Sergeant Baldy for his UDoom                      	     	texture pack for Doom 2, and his contributions to the Doom Community in general; Snarbo and the lads from Doomworld for proposing                	        this project and for their extremely valuable help and support; Graham McNeill, for overcoming his limitations as a writer to own                  	        the Heresy; my mum, for giving birth to me; all the little people I've left behind =D

* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : [At Snarbo's discretion] -------------------------------------------
Single Player           : Designed for
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : No

Other game styles       : No
Difficulty Settings     : Yes

Note: The map has had some thought about Deathmatch and Co-Operative play, but the original layout was intended for single player altering this balance would breach the rules of this project and also require the original author's vision to be thrown in the bin. 


* Construction *

Base                    : Modified 1994 map (WOODHAL2.WAD)
Build Time              : Bloody ages, I want my life back! (About 2 weeks)
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder

Known Bugs              : 1. Sometimes the sky and music seem to reset themselves to default in Boom -- I've got no idea why this happens. The map seems to 				work perfectly in ZDoom. Being English I pronounce it "ZED-DOOM" and always have a chuckle when I hear someone say "ZEE-DOOM" ;).
			2. Alignment problems in certain areas, probably due to height irregularities in the original map. This is beyond my ability to fix 				without redoing the heights of every room in the map.
			
May Not Run With        : Vanilla Doom 2
Tested With             : ZDoom, Boom


Note: One area of this map has been altered beyond recognition (when you enter the corridor leading to the blue area) - originally this rectangular corridor was a masterfully built curved tunnel which linked the starting area (now the Great Hall) with the wooden maze area (now the Blue Area). Unfortunately, making visual alterations to the curved tunnel proved beyond my ability and I had already spent more than a month working on the map so I replaced this area altogether. While curved areas are rare in Doom I don't think anyone will miss a blank, empty wooden area which couldn't be upgraded without ruining the whole thing.
