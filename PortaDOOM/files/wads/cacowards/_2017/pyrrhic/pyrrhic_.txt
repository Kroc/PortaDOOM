Description             : 15 tested and finely tuned maps for duel. Uses stock Doom 2 textures for a clean old school style. Hard difficulty includes BFG. 
Other difficulties remove the BFG with some weapon rearrangement, possibly for FFA applications where BFG spam is unwanted.
Requires a limit removing port.
