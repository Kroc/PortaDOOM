Backstory
---------

It's some years after Hell On Earth. You prevented the demonic invasion and the threat has subsided. The UAC has been greatly discredited as a result of the catastrophes on Phobos, Deimos and Earth. After completing a contract to eradicate the sporadic remaining factions of Hell their military funds are removed and thier remit restricted to researching advancement in treating those suffering combat fatigue from the invasion. Those who had survived close encounters with Spider Masterminds had particulary acute symptoms of hysteria. After alerting your Commanding Officer to your horrifying premonitions of a new attack from Hell you are referred to the UAC who diagnose you with the new condition: Hadephobia.

------------------------------
MAP01 - Escape From The Asylum
------------------------------

The nightmares have begun again. The same night terrors you had during the Phobos and Deimos invasions. The same dreams that returned with the forces of Hell on the attack on Earth. Claws scratching out guts, jaws chewing through bone, fireballs burning off flesh. You are more certain than anything. Hell is back.

You urgently inform your Commanding Officer but it proves a waste of your breath. The UAC are bent on distancing themselves with the former attrocities and ignore your warnings. Strong arm attempts at persuasion leave you institutionalized in the military sick bay.

Time passes. Days or weeks you are not sure. Time melds together as does reality in a drug induced blur. Then one morning you wake from your med addled slumber. Everything is silent and your senses feel clear. You crawl through a busted vent and out of your cell alerting creatures in the hospital corridor. 
You want to think you are in another nightmare but your insticts are sharp enough to tell you this is for real. You blast your way through the asylum, searching for security clearance before finally hitting the elevator switch. Your first thought is to find your C.O. and thrust the severed head of a demon in his face as the proof he needs, but then consider the possibility he is already dead, along with many others. The chamber moves in the shaft and you tighten your grip on your weapon in anticipation of the elevator doors opening...

------------------------
MAP02 - Storage Basement
------------------------

...In the middle of your way down you hear some strange noises above your head. You get frightened as you're expecting some nasty hellspawn getting in the elevator in order to kill you. Suddenly, the elevator jolts to a stop between the seventh and eighth floor and, hearing a scratching noise from the elevator shaft, you must face the awful truth: They're not going to toast you. It's much worse. Just a moment later, you are lifted from your feet and your head knocks the ceiling of the elevator. Gravity pulls down this huge metal monstrum - and you're trapped in it!

But wait... do you have to panic? You're a brave space marine - top of the class in survival training. It is doubtless that you're supposed to survive! An echoing bang breaks the gloomy silence in the hospital's cellar as the elevator lands on the bottom of the shaft. You were braced for broken bones but find you have nothing apart from some minor bruising. The elevator is more busted up than you are, the door is jammed closed but you find a way out through another air vent exposed from the crash and soon you end up in storage. You re-evaluate your situation and risk-assess the sewer as the safest route due to being the sector least prone to infestation but access is locked. You must find the way to the control room, which sets your way free into the sewers. As you are on your way through the dark, you have to face another unpleasant surprise. The arrival of the elevator alerted those horrendous hellspawn down here. Your way through this darkness won't be easy. You hold on to your gun and prepare for the worst thing ever to happen to you. After some uncertain roamings back and forth, killing everything that moves in your way, you finally find the switch which opens the pathway to the sewers. You go downstairs, get into the tunnel and venture blindly ahead into the endless darkness...

-----------------------------
MAP03 - The Stench of Freedom
-----------------------------

...You begin to wonder if heading into the sewers was a smart idea. The smell is awful and is making you nauseous. A cold breeze blows into your face and brings the smell with it, making you gag.

Wait a minute... a cold breeze? A way out of here may be closer than you thought. You quicken your pace, demons are teleporting directly into the sewer now, and you don't want to be around when the welcoming party brings all of it's friends. You turn the corner inside a snaking tunnel and catch a glimpse of sunlight. A large pipe is belching sewer water into the local river but there's a big metal gate blocking it. You hunt around and find two switches unlocking the barrier and finally make your way outside to the edge of the pipe.

The river outside is flowing fast down a steep rocky mountain side. You hesitate, but quickly make up your mind to jump as demons start teleporting in behind you...

-----------------
MAP04 - Washed Up
-----------------

...The moment you crash into the river you realise you underestimated it's current. As if to confirm so you are pulled violent into jagged rock - knocking the wind out your lungs. You try to struggle against the white rapids but soon you're thrashed again. Your fight gives out and you slip into unconciousness...

...You wake beached on a rocky terrain. By chance just your lower half is submerged in a calm spring that leads off from the river. At the opposite bank of the river you see the asshole end of the hospital you were shit from and bobbing in the stream are the bodies of less fortunate jetsam. One of them gurgles as if to speak and you realise he's still alive! He says you are on a largely uninhabited island where survival is impossible but there may be a small chance of escape by smuggling yourself onto a frieght ship that docks here. His words then become unintelligible and he finally gives out to death.

You wonder how long you were uncouncious for. You guess about an hour as it has darkened but it is not yet night. You decide to try to make good time searching for the dock before the nightfall but your progress is hampered by the teleporting hordes of Hell and an untraversable landscape. You eventually find a passage dug out of a cavern. An officer had holed himself in there until a particulary large beast forced it's way through. You take his security pass to access the dam station. In there you lower the dam to flood out the ravine - allowing you to reach higher ground and the entrance to the dock.

The entrance is guarded by large floating demons and more teleporting zombies. After you dispatch the last of them you throw the entrance switch and hope you're able to hold off whatever awaits you until the ship arrives...

---------------------
MAP05 - Rumex Crispus
---------------------

...You listen to the comforting seal of the door kissing the ground. But then, you're struck by the following silence. All you hear are your own lungs, your heart exploding, the echoes of battle still ringing in your ears.

A strangeness creeps over you. A tangible dread sends you reeling suddenly, and you feel as if you may be sick. Then thoughts begin to pour out...you begin to wonder who you are, and whether any of this is real. Your eyes betray a plastic sheen on the walls and the ground you seem to be standing on. It's not real.

As the door ahead of you opens you feel a refreshing cool breeze. You remember that one time, you might have enjoyed playing on the beach. Now the shore just makes you feel vulnerable. There's nowhere to hide on the shores of hell.

What you find outside the door is baffling, but for some reason you feel familiar with it. You feel as if you're on some kind of drug, and you're watching yourself go through the motions of being a soldier.

Progressing among the docks, you start to think the sky is telling you something. You realize you're in a place that nobody can take you out of. The only way is through, through this distorted mess. It doesn't seem to make sense, but you can't help yourself. A primal urgency pulls you forward, while you cut down the demons in a daze. Finally you give up any semblance of restraint and decide to pilot your own ship. Setting sail with no destination, you accept the chaos that seems to be lying ahead of you, on the edge of the earth...

---------------------
MAP06 - Hull Revealed
---------------------

...Inside the ship, you notice that hell has taken full control over it, and the ship is on the move. Where is it going, you don't know. You could try to get the ship under your control, kill all the demons and go get some help from the big UAC bases not too far from here, but when you come to the ship's control room, some sort of force suddenly teleports you away. While you search for a method to get out, you notice that the crates onboard the ship are open and are full of some kind of mineral. You quickly move on and find a key that will open a way out.

Finally, after clearing the upper deck, you find a second control area - only to find that the destination of the ship has been pre-programmed which cannot be overriden and no manual control exists. Short of jumping overboard you have no option but to see where the ship will dock...

---------------------------
MAP07 - Deadly Exploitation
---------------------------

...The ship stalls several feet short so you have to swim to shore. Your curiosity increases as it appears to be bordered by metal fences. Following a rocky path, you arrive in a yard with two huge grey mountains and a blood fountain. The metal gate closes behind you.

You notice that the bigger mountain is actually a built-in base. Once before, humankind tracked this landscape down and it turned out to be a huge locality of precious metal. Now, like the asylum you escaped from, it has been overrun by Hell's minions.

You wonder where Hell's reaches extend to. Is the entire earth once again under attack? You decide you will get your answers accessing the base.

Hell's influence is evident everywhere you look. Tortured miners and Satantic symbolism adorn the base and you must find demonic keys to unlock doors blocking significant areas. One console screen you find has a log of events detailing the invasion. It states the miners unwittingly released a faction of Hell who had seemingly been trapped beneath fallen rock during the first invasion on Earth. It is a brief message intended to be be a warning but it had not been sent before it's writer was killed. Attempts to send it yourself prove futile as communications are out.

You realise that you must make sure this faction is exterminated before trying to finally find a way off the island. This means a trip down the mine and to the source of the new invasion...

-------------------
MAP08 - Sub-Station
-------------------

...what you expected to be the mine had been now been converted to a station. Evidence of a working mine such as cart tracks and dug rock walls survive but built over it is a terminal for a train line. It appears the UAC had exhausted the precious metal and dug deeper still for more.

Hitting switches opens up the base and eventually you find the train to the new mine. You hit the switch to start the engine and hold tight as you set it to full speed...

----------------
MAP09 - Terminus
----------------

...for a long time the train sped through seemingly endless tunnels before suddenly the end of the line appeared ahead and you hit the screeching brakes. You have not had any sort of sleep since being unconcious after jumping from the sewer but now the demonic voices have seeped into your waking mind. You don't know whether your sanity is slipping or this relates to your ever increasing proximity to the origin of Hell's new assualt.

The level at which you entered is the abandoned mine with each deeper level being increasingly bent by Hell's influence. At the lift's lowest level is unmined rock, and a river of molton lava with towering step-stones that you cross with some trepidation. Finally you reach a huge wooden door. You are certain that Hell and the Mastermind you hunt, lie somewhere behind it...

-----------------------
MAP10 - Excavation Site
-----------------------

...After you enter the door you reach a huge underground cavern, which shows some hell influence, but you don't have time for sightseeing because as soon as you enter, the demons start attacking you. You manage to deafeat them and head towards a door in the walls of the cave. What lies behind it is something you saw countless times already. The architecture looks human, although it's been drastically changed by hell, clearly they call this cave their home now.
You fight your way through the complex and see the bloody corpses of the miners who once worked there almost everywhere, their skin decorates the walls, and their blood makes rivers.

You find an opening in one of the walls, it has a wooden door and you know that you want whatever is inside it; this seems to be the place where hell started to take control, the architecture is different and you can see flesh under the floor, this time you're not dreaming (aren't you?). In top of a flesh pillar you can see a skull, the ones used to open locked doors. you lower the pillar and defeat the demons that teleport into the room.
While walking around the complex, you start wondering, was the UAC really just mining here? Was the encounter with the mastemind is really bad luck? Or is there something more to this whole invasion?

You soon forget about all those questions when you meet another of hell's "Welcome Parties" in another part of the cave. After kicking their demonic asses you find another skull key, You then proceed to use it and unlock a door near where you entered the cave. You fight your way to the remaining hellspawn and enter yet another hell built wooden area, although this time you see a huge hole in front of you. Against all common sense, you jump in...

-------------------------------
MAP11 - Descent into Underworld
-------------------------------

...When you jump in that hole, you feel in a familiar place, like visiting a dream. You have seen this place in your visions at the asylum, but now it is so brutally real. 

You feel like you're being called from a some sort of entity, the mastermind maybe. You feel powerless to resist and so you go to investigate. You're suprised how weakly guarded the cavern is but the huge burning rocks and deep pits of molton lava fill you with an ominous dread. One walkway collapses underfoot making you realise you won't get out the way you got in and the only way forward involves leaping accross rocks high above the certain death of the sulphur lake beneath. In the centre is a marble fortress, which crumbles to nothing revealing the Spider Mastermind before you. The creature teleports between rocks and attacks you from all angles but eventually you take it down. It's still alive but slipping fast. You decide to leave it in it's misery to die alone. The voices in your head are as strong as ever before but pathetically maudlin now.

Strange triggers raise more rocks up out of the lava to allow you accross the other side of the lake where you find a portal in the form of a wailing wall of trapped souls. They beg you to leave and all your insticts agree but there's no where else to go. With some trepidation you charge through the portal trying not to think too hard about what's on the other side...

----------------
MAP12 - Passover
----------------

...Through the vortex you are ported into a brown bricked outpost. As you take your first step forwards the choir of Hell that had polluted your mind abruptly cease thier ghoulish whispers. You turn around to see the portal has vanished. You conclude the Spidermastermind must have died and taken it's portal and hive-mind back to Hell with it. The outpost appears to have been purpose built as a reception to Demons porting out of the Mastermind's cavern. It seems the Mastermind wanted to concentrate her army in this area. You work your way outside and through the outer gate to find out what the Mastermind was attacking...

-----------------------
MAP13 - Metal Territory
-----------------------

...So this is what's been happening up on the surface while you've been underground. You wasn't sure what to make of brick building the portal transported you to but, after you fight through a rocky valley, ahead of you is unmistakably a UAC structure. At least it used to be. Now it's another outpost of the undead. You have no choice but to start investigating this gothic structure - which doesn't seem to be an easy task to do.

As soon as you set foot in the valley, the demons surround you from every direction. You make a terrible bloodbathing massacre amongst them, but finishing, you ecounter the fall-out of a similar massacre. The lifeless bodies of a dozen or so demons are strewn before the fortress, whilst the door itself is decorated by a Cyberdemon skull. The gruesome scene does nothing to ease you. You can't help wondering what has caused this carnage. Suddenly, a demotic metal structure takes your attention with rhythmic snoring inside - the worst thing ever considered: A Cyberdemon, luckily sleeping. It has been caged here by it's own kind, a the prisoner of this demonic civil war.

Inside the fort the walls are lined by the minerals that caught your attention on the freight ship and mine. Some UAC artifacts have survived the Demonic subversion and you are surprised to find a working console. Records left by the UAC show they were experimenting on using the mineral to block a psychic link they had discovered between Hell and hadephobics, with the fort being designed as a safehouse. You consider the visions you suffered and realise you were being exploited by the UAC. In the end though it was the UAC who were exploited by the demons as it was the mining of this material that led to their demise. You zoom out on the console map to find you are on another island not far from the two you've already been on. Zooming back in again you locate other key UAC buildings that you expect the Hell Spawn would be keen to invade.

Without much hope you try communication lines but again they fail due to a lack of power. The whole base network is powered by an emergency generator in a power station built into one of the islands caves. If you can kick start the other generators perhaps you can get a message to the world beyond these infected islands. While you're searching for further information, the Cyber suddenly wakes up and ecounters you. You have no chance but to fight him and then search for that power station immediately...

----------------
MAP14 - Power Up
----------------

...You have found a base. Maybe the generator is there? You walked and wandered around and then you found a corrupt door and some secret tunnel. Blood still looks fresh, hell must have entered here a few minutes ago. You entered it and killed every ugly face in your way. You found the generator, but it is turned off. There are 4 unconnected wires, they should be connected and then the generator will turn on.

After you activated it, it started to make loud noises and shake. Because of the stress of the machine, the floor under you corrupted and melted down in the nuclear. But you noticed some tunnel underground...

--------------------------
MAP15 - Septic Underbelly
--------------------------

...The concrete beneath you fell away under the stress of the powering turbines to be replaced by the shallow splash of a green corrosive sludge. You quickly move onto a nearby kerb and realise that there is a series of sub-rooms the UAC had built beneath the power station to process the radioactive discard.

You've not got far before the cursed voices filled your head again. Weaker than before, as if you've hardened to them, but still there. You head deep into the bowels of the plant where you find the source of your torment - another Spider Mastermind. You wonder how this could be and come to the conclusion that after the monsters had escaped they had raised a breeding ground or a portal to Hell. This is another concern for later, right now you concentrate on felling the Spiderdemon.

After you vanquished your foe you search grim flesh and marble for the access key cards you need to progress. You take a close look at a ripped open wall. It is man-made at it's deepest, with a lining of flesh covering it and marble brick covering that. It appears Hell subverts the material by first covering it in this rancid flesh that spreads accross walls like moss and then hardens somehow into satanic materials.

You are close to exiting when you find a small radio facility. Eager to test the powerlines you switch it on, just to find it's an internal network only. You're about to head on when a distress signal from two marines flashes on-screen. They say they're trapped in sector 31 - the UAC armoury. The time stamp on the recording is several hours ago, which means they outlived most of the other UAC staff. But they are probably dead now.

You're left in quandary. Do you take the decrepit lift up the mountianside to the Communication Tower or do your crawl through the flesh hole into the UAC Armoury and try to save lives?...

----------------------
MAP31 - Hell's Armoury
----------------------

...Maybe you shouldn't have jumped down here after all. It's hard to see through how dark it is, but from the looks of it the base has been compl- wait, over there. There appears to be an entrance to the base through rotting flesh, though only the door remains unchanged by the deterioration. Entering, you discover that a large portion of the armory still remains intact, but something else seems off...

As you enter the yellow key door, you realize that the boundaries of hell here have been completely torn down. This is one of their entrances to the mortal realm, and the only way to prevent more from coming is to go in and close this portion. After entering the correct portal, you see a small fortress, and realize that the men you saw on the radar are likely deep within the confines of the fortress.

Unfortunately, the way to them is blocked by a red key, and you're not sure about running after them further. If they've been dragged this far, the chances of them having survived is slim to none. You take off for now, not sure if you'll return for them. After all, what are two men to the millions already likely slaughtered by the forces of hell?

After a small skirmish in the armory, you return with the key. You begin to contemplate on going back in for the men or just continuing you previous mission. Decisions, decisions...

-----------------------
MAP32 - Sirenum Scopuli
-----------------------

...The moment you stepped into the shallow torrent of blood you are violently pulled in the current along with the marines into the darkness. You try shouting to them but get no response and keep losing sight of them as the tunnel twists, turns and plunges into the pitch black.

Suddenly, as the tunnel banks out of a bend you see both marines dead within the blink of an eye. One of them horribly disfigured. You are clearly being swallowed into the belly of a trap but there's no way of returning.

Without warning you warp into what appears at first glance to be another UAC installation but your insticts warn you to distrust. Your instincts prove right as the ceiling falls in jagged angles crushing monsters beneath. You explore the base and eventually find a teleporter which takes you back into the fast moving river of blood. Any hopes of it taking you back from where you came are shattered when you warp again and find yourself in a new foriegn zone.

You are surrounding by barrels and powerful beasts materialise everywhere causing havoc. The area appears to have been built from man-made material but in increasingly bizarre abstract designs. Following another battle with a huge Cybernetic demon overlord you find another teleport which leads back to the blood filled tunnel. You feel like you're being toyed with.

Your next location is unmistakenly Hell. An abyssal cauldron of lava hosts islands of rock that raise and lower perpetually. You navigate the guantlet in the searing heat while fending off floating terrors and finally make a break for the exit. Goblets of gore shower down on you as you fly through the final warp - relieved to find yourself back in the UAC waste processing plant where resistence is thinned and you can finally get back to your primary mission of finding the Communication Tower...

---------------------------
MAP16 - Eisenhower Heliport
---------------------------

... After escaping the nuclear waste and the second spider mastermind nest, you found yourself at the climb of the mountain, where another station waiting for you, here's the Eisenhower heliport, a forgotten old base now used as a refueling station and a island personel barracks, and you can see in the middle of the mountain valley a green brick tower, the Communication Tower that will help you to dispatch the broken signal of the marine base. You think you'd better check out some of the caves around the mountain summit for some kind of object to lower the bars and get your way to the tower... 

But the spiderdemon influence is still heavy in the neighbourhood, and some hellish parts are around the installation, dying and decandent.

Patroling the human barracks, you found a map in the mess hall, The map shows the dormitory, a storage, a giant teleport station, and near it a place called "the firehouse". Inside this place you found some exavacations in the entry hall, is locked by some tape, and it leads to the old sewers, you heard some strange engining noises from the open hole... maybe this section is interconnected with the Communication Tower?

The valley is divided by a little river, but for some reason it became a nuke river, maybe there's a nuclear plant somewhere that junked their waste in the river...

You reach the last base, and after you climb the stairs you finally reach the communication tower, what danger's awaiting you?...

---------------------------
MAP17 - Communication Tower
---------------------------

...Once reaching the top of the Communication Tower you find that all the equipment is gone. All that remains is the power generator. Well, gazing past the generator you spy a wierd looking building. At fist glance it looks like a typical tech base but on closer inspection you notice that the bas of the building is an ancient ruin. Looking around futher you find that there is nothing else around. You jump down off the tower and start the trek towards the building...

----------------------
MAP18 - Altar of Chaos
----------------------

...Upon entering the ruin, you realize that whoever- or whatever- took the comm equipment from the tower must have taken refuge here. While the UAC's presence seems sparse, you know that they've done significant research here.

As you make your way through the subterranean complex, you come across some sort of place of worship.  It has the look of an abbey for Satan... What such a structure would be doing in such an ancient ruin is an answer you can't come across. A subtle sign gets those wheels in your head 'a-turning. The equipment rests atop the altar. Still, there's a faint notion running through your head. Is this the original place of human contact with Hell?

There's no time to ponder that. As you approach the altar, chaos erupts around you. They knew you were coming. In a blink, the equipment is damaged. In disgust, you spot the only other way out... and it goes deeper into the ruin...

------------------------
MAP19 - Satan's Fortress
------------------------

...The evil temple is just left behind. In front of you lies the dark, hellish cave and all you hear is infinite roarings coming from various angles and sources. Despite being a bit worried, you still decide to continue your trek ahead. Your steps are echoing on the surface of the rough stones. Soon, a chaotic crowd surrounds you. Wiping the sweat and brainpieces off your forehead, you start thinking about getting overground but first you have to run the guantlet of the underground fortress. It is by far the worst place you've encountered on your journey, but it's the only way you can go in order to get to the spawning vat in which the invasion is blooming. It takes all of your efforts but finally you feel the cool fresh air on your skin and realise you're near the surface. You hit a switch and step onto the lift to take you to ground level and prepare yourself for what you expect will be the fight of your life in the Breeding Grounds...

-----------------------
MAP20 - Ostoyae Anomaly
-----------------------

...You take in deep breaths of the clean, fresh air and feel it cleanse your lungs but the dejection you feel because of the broken communication equipment and your failed attempts to flee the island is not so easily vanquished from your system.

You trudge through the rocky valley ahead of you. At the end is another UAC facility. You remember back to the island map you saw and recognise it's location as a laboratory. Your hope piques. You'd bet anything the UAC has built a teleporter and it may just take you off the island. You hope you find it before the demons do.

Inside the lab it is strangely unpopulated, although the presence of Hell is apparent by the flesh covering the walls, floors and ceilings. Further in, the atmosphere changes darker still. The lab has been smothered by an all consuming organism. The same foul flesh that has creeped over all of this island's constructs like an infection. It's root is here in the lab, spewing endless creatures from Hell into Earth's realm.

In a lab not yet fully consumed by flesh you find a hadephobia sufferer strung up - no doubt the subject of some inhumane experiment. Behind locked gates you find more pods smothered under flesh. You put one poor guy out of his torment and the organism seems to feel it so you find the others and do the same. With the last one dead the organism finally collapses but the monsters keep coming. Behind it is the UAC teleporter but it too has been bent by Hell. Corrupted to bring in the endless army of Hades. You know that going through is not going to take you anywhere good but you can't think of another way to stop it...

--------------------
MAP21 - Constriction
--------------------

...You warp to what seems to be the entrance to a large temple inside a cavern. Once again, you've come back to Hell. Looks like you'll have to kick it's ass one more time...

-------------------
MAP22 - Prime Mover
-------------------

...As you venture deeper into the depths of Hell, you come across the usual piles of human flesh and - strangely - parts of machines. As you wonder why Hell needs this machinery, whilst blasting the heads off some demons, you meet a not so dear friend: the Baphomet.
So Hell needed all those resources for rebuilding the Gatekeeper? Maybe. But the thing doesn't seem to be alive yet. And it won't be! You need to find some way to destroy it before it wakes up...

------------------
MAP23 - Gloom Keep
------------------

...you come to a sort of hellish, brick fortress surrounded by the darkness of hell itself.
Moving deeper into the fort, you realize something's not right. The demonic bastards seem to be using the fort to spawn new monsters for the final invasion on Earth. 
Not on my watch, you think, and walk into the only accessible chamber and lay a few bullets into the spawn switch.
Further down the hall lies a teleport to Earth. You curse out loud, as the bridge is down, and realize that is how the demons are getting to Earth. You figure theres gotta be another portal around here, and continue into the fort.
Eventually you come to a giant, skeletal door. You can only imagine whats beyond it- but this is it. You have to finish this. You press the switch to open the door and walk inside...

-----------------
MAP24 - Lifeblood
-----------------

...You proceed through another gothic stronghold and find a window allowing you another glimpse into the baphomet's lair from another angle. You're suprised to be gazing upon it through a gushing waterfall of toxic nukage. Why? You cannot be sure. But you can be certain that wicked forces are rebuilding the Mother of Hell and that the unlikely presence of this Earthly commodity cannot be coincidence. You decide stopping the nukeage flow is your best bet of ceasing the unholy resurection and set off in search of it's origin. Progress takes you through an increasingly hostile Hellish environment and it's natives. You continue your journey seemingly deeper into Hell's core with whatever hope you can summon...

-----------------
MAP25 - Sacrifice
-----------------

...Your journey takes you into what looks like a Hellish chapel built on the precipice of a volcanic abyss on the verge of eruption. You find no further evidence of nukeage you found flowing into the Baphomet but you are convinced your earlier hunch is correct when you discover a demonic shrine in it's honour. You just about escape with your skin by opening up an exit through a gushing bloodfall...

----------------------------
MAP26 - Pride of the Descent
----------------------------

...you still feel the burnt ash of the molton lake on your skin, even during the brief fall into that mysterious pit with the bloodfall. Suddenly, you find yourself in a cave that overlooks a field covered in layers of dust, skin, and hellslime. You have lost trace of the nukage flow but hope the refinery which produces all the waste to resuscitate the Baphomet should lie this way. The way down is locked by a haunted fort opposing the cave. And not just the fort, the enemies. They're coming ceaselessly. Your time is taken.
The actual question now is your survival rather than the destruction of the drilling machine. It won't be an easy task to venture through the pure hellish fields and discover all the mortality of this hadistic-sadistic red brick library...

------------------------
MAP27 - Drilling Station
------------------------

...You explore more infernal caves, which seem to claustraphobically close in on you. You clear out several areas then, in a flash, you are frozen in fear as you're caught unawares by a brief vision of the huge Cybernetic demon, which vanishes as suddenly as it manifested. After regaining your composure you notice that, entombed in the hot red rock, is what appears to be the walls of a UAC structure. This must be the refinery. You are relieved to find the electronic doors still work and enter the densley populated central cavern, which is being drilled for the corrosive green nukage. It is here that the dreaded guardian of the security key card reappears but, using the rocky arches as cover, you eventually slay them all. You use the key to access the fiercly guarded control station. Once you dropped the last of the resistance you look out into the Baphomet's lair where falls of nukage flow and are dejected in the realisation you are probably too late. A column lowers revealing a teleportation pad. If any chance of preventing the resurrection of the baphonet is gone your next best hope is to take it face on...

----------------------------
MAP28 - Teleportation Center
----------------------------

...You get a feeling of deja vu as you arrive at the other end of the teleporter, you've been here before. It looks like the UACs main center for research into teleportation technology, but it's completely infested. A hint of brimstone fills your lungs, apparently this place isn't in Texas anymore. As you fight your way through the hordes you discover that the demons have activated the large portal in the main area of the base, have they transported the Baphomet to another UAC base? It would be a disaster if they've taken it to the Earth's surface, who knows what sort of destruction it could cause! You dive through the portal and hope for the best...

...The portal takes you into another UAC base. You make your way out outside in search of the Baphomet and immediately realise you're back on Earth. It's a ruined mess though. Hell's invasion had progressed much faster than you dared to hope and the planet is beyond salvation.

In the distance you see a hovering spaceship in a UAC compound. You identify it as a personel carrier, which means the UAC are planning an evacuation. Your mission now is to get to the compound and join the escape party before it leaves. Only problem is the compound has been heavily secured against Hell's forces by several locked gates and a lowered bridge. Not to mention Earth's population has now been replaced by Demons.

After literally going through Hell you finally make it through the Demon proof gates and into the UAC compound. From here on it should be easy...

...You should have guessed by now that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. The compound is densely guarded by rioting demons. The door you need to access to board the Evacuation Ark is secured and as you progress in reaching the access keycard further reinforcements are deployed from Hell to make life harder.

Finally, after vanquishing the last of the infernal defence, you breach the Ark and finally permit yourself some optimism as the thunder of the burning jets lift you up towards the atmosphere of the subjugated hellground that is now Humanity's former home...
