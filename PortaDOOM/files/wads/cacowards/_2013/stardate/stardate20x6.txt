Misc. Author Info       : 
Description             : Stardate 20X6 is a set of 8 boom-compatible
                          levels that are all about the color purple. I
                          couldn't think of a wad that extensively used
                          the color so I decided to spend some time and
                          completely overdose on it. The levels meander
                          through underground and space-station themes,
                          and are filled with all sorts of abstract violet
                          goodness. Much of the gameplay resembles the
                          arena style typically found in slaughtermaps,
                          but the monster counts (in general) aren't
                          overwhelmingly high. The maps are very difficult,
                          with UV hopefully presenting a worthy challenge
                          even for veteran doomers. HMP is also
                          implemented, and is intended for casual
                          playthroughs.

Additional Credits to   : Many textures ripped from cc4-tex.wad, so props
                          to anyone involved in the creation of those.

* Play Information *

Other game styles       : No
Difficulty Settings     : Yes. Most time was spent balancing UV play, but
                          I also implemented HMP. HNTR is pretty much the
                          same as HMP, but with a few slight changes. so I
                          recommend playing ITYTD if HMP is too rough.

May Not Run With...     : Any port that doesn't support:
                             - boom linedefs / voodoo doll shennanigans
                             - midi playback
Other                   : Glboom+ recommended for best results!

                          In gzdoom there are a few graphical quirks
                          in the outside area of map06, but it's not too
                          terrible. In software graphics some of the self-
                          referencing sectors in the first map look funky.

 ///////   MAP LIST:   ////////
//////////////////////////////
===========================================================================

map01: Amethyst II
------------------
music: marswar.wad, map 32

A simple starter map, an introduction to the world of purple and brown.


map02: Mud Bunny
----------------
music: "Forbidden Area" from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

An underground base surrounded by curvy caverns of brownness! This level
gets pretty tough towards the end, several areas are slaughter-esque.


map03: Foxhole
--------------
music: "icicles.mid" by James Paddock

The big open caverns have been traded for claustrophobic burrows; Winding
tunnels between larger areas, ending with a big arena.


map04: Tanagra
--------------
music: Level 3 from Super R-Type

Shaka, when the walls fell... Welcome to gray.
A sizable nonlinear space-station map, this one isn't too difficult.


map05: Sector 8
---------------
music: Kraken theme from Earthbound

The universe is a little bit like the human hand...
Another space-station grayfest, I went a bit overboard with the purple/
black theme on this one. This map cranks the difficulty back up.


map06: Vehelits
---------------
music: "Alien Power" from Streets of Rage 2

A vicious map from start to finish. There are a plethora of routes
to take and many dangerous rooms to explore, good luck!


map07: Magnus
-------------
music: "Native" from Gubble

A giant twisted purple base filled to the brim with hellspawn and
merciless traps. Kudos to players brave enough to play this one on UV!


map31: Hyperspace
-----------------
music: "Better Off Alone" by Alice Deejay

A disco space-station infested with Arch-Viles, oh no!
