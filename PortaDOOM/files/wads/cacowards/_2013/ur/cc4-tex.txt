Notable changes in version 1.5:
Texture PLAT128B has been removed due to Boom being incompatible with
256-tall textures. Oops! I was unaware of this when I originally compiled
the wad. Affected maps should replace it with PLAT128A.

Textures BRONZEB5, BRONZEB6, BRONZEG5, and BRONZEG6 have been replaced with
significantly improved versions that I made more recently. My old versions
that were there before were rather crappy; hopefully the replacement won't
cause any problems.

Flats HEXA01, HEXA02, and HEXA03 have been replaced with improved versions
that I made more recently. The differences between these and the old ones
shouldn't be significant enough to cause any problems.
