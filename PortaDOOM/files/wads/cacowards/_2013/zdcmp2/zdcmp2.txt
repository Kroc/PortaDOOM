Description             : As the successor to the ZDCMP1, the second take follows
			  the same rules: Various mappers and modders are working
			  on fixed dates/slots on the map and continueing where
			  the prior person has stopped. Expect a high quality 
			  Doom experience with countless surprises and numerous
			  things that push ZDoom to its limits.
