Description             : Another FFA 32in24, except with a unique app-
			  roach: one person creates a layout, and another
			  mapper focuses on detailing the layout heavily
			  and overall refining the map to perfection.  All
			  layouts were completed in 24 hours, within 48
			  hours almost all were detailed, and in the next
			  two days, the wad was compiled and released.

Additional Credits to   : Esselfortium cheifly for putting in way too many
			  hours in mapping, detailing, refining, tweaking,
			  compiling, putting together the texture wad,
			  editing posts, and never losing his head like
			  A CERTAIN CO-LEADER OF THE 32IN24 PROJECT.

			  On that note, deathz0r for not only not contrib-
			  uting, but also fucking up the release of
			  32in24-4.wad (CTF.)  If you ever wondered why
			  getwad downloads this wad, and then your client
			  of choice tells you it's the wrong file, wonder
			  no more.  Turnabout is fair play!

			  DD_133 for initially compiling the wad!

			  Ajapted for finding a ton of bugs!

                          Tom_D for the map03 music! Bobby Prince, Raven
                          Software, Apocalyptica, and some other people
                          for the rest of it!

			  All the people whose textures we used: Gothic
			  Resource Wad, Nick Baker's Greatest Hits
                          Collection, Raven Software, id Software,
                          SargeBaldy, Skulltag, Espi, RuinBros,
                          Esselfortium, and anyone else we forgot to list.

			  Agent Spork for permission to use the Simplicity
			  palette :) and for disappearing after the first
			  night of mapping with a half done wad :(

			  And finally myself (Shaikoten) for coming up with
			  the idea, organization, and making the interpic.

BONUS RANTING		: Besides producing a very high quality map pack,
			  the goal of this project for me, personally, was
			  to experiment with new ways to put together Doom
			  megawads.  I would like to write a manifesto, if
			  you will, about my current thoughts on project
			  compilation, and I hope someone finds them
			  helpful or inspiring.

			  32in24 basically started as a joke.  I was on
			  IRC, and most of the people in #unidoom were
			  bored, so I said "Let's make a 32 map megawad in
			  24 hours!" sarcastically.  People started
			  responding enthusiastically, so deathz0r and I
			  actually put the project together.  Amazingly, we
			  completed all 32 maps before the deadline and had
			  a playable, rough around the edges DM megawad.

			  This got me thinking though.  If we can complete
			  a functional, if ugly megawad in a day, with no
			  project advertisement beforehand in 24 hours,
			  imagine what else we could accomplish?  With a
			  group of faithful mappers, we started going down
			  the list of game modes, with each wad more and
			  more polished, culminating in 32in24-4, a couple
			  of weeks ago.  Still, there were some naysayers
			  within the Doom community who called our maps
			  low quality, simply on the basis that they were
			  ugly.

			  So our maps are ugly.  Some people are refusing
			  to participate in the event or play the wads
			  because of it.  How do you speedmap something
			  that just screams quality, though?

			  The answer turned out to be simple.  Some people
			  have trouble making layouts, and take forever,
			  while others have the same problem with details.
			  So why not have one team do what they're good at,
			  and the other do what they're good at?  We did,
			  and I'm pleased with the results.  In just a few
			  days, we took maps that looked like turds and
			  polished them into gems, and presented an overall
			  very high quality wad.

			  But there are other benefits to this system of
			  mapping that a lot of people have voiced to me,
			  which were completely unexpected.  For example,
			  I had one mapper tell me that he wasn't feeling
			  very confident or having a lot of fun with
			  mapping on his own, but after he participated in
			  a few 32in24s, he found his output greatly
			  increased, his maps looking and playing better
			  than ever, and his desire to map also increased.

			  Why was this?  Well we discussed it, and the
			  reason seemed to be the condensed time and the
			  close community in 32in24.  You can upload your
			  map in this project and get constructive criti-
			  cism almost instantly, and if you can't do some-
			  thing, another mapper will do it for you and give
			  you the wad back so you can learn how to.  It
			  also adds a sense of both urgency, and comradarie
			  to what's usually just sitting in a chair and
			  clicking in your favorite editor for a few hours.

			  I overheard another mapper talking to a project
			  lead of a different DM map project say, "we
			  should do _____ like 32in24!"  At first I was
			  flattered, and then I really thought about it.
			  They SHOULD do their project like 32in24.  I can
			  think of certain instances where the setup would
			  not flow smoothly, but for a DM or CTF megawad?
			  It's the perfect way to create a map pack with
			  the least effort and hassle, and to produce the
			  best final result, as I see it.

			  So I encourage other mappers to use what we have
			  learned with these past five projects, to focus
			  on what we will learn in future projects, and
			  apply it to the construction of their wads.  I
			  also encourage mappers of any skill level to
			  participate in 32in24 projects coming in the
			  future.  It's a good experience for mappers of
			  any skill level or discipline.  Thanks for
			  reading through this, and if you made it this
			  far, by golly, you've earned yourself a cookie.
