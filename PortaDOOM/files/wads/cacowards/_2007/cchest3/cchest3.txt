* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : One year
Editor(s) used          : Too many to list
Known Bugs              : In ZDoom 2.1.7, it is possible to get stuck in
                          MAP03: Mineopoly after raising the rock stairs,
                          as the engine does not properly handle the map's
                          voodoo doll script, rendering the switch to lower
                          the stairs inaccessible.  This does not occur in
                          any other source port.
                          
                          MAP28: Token Arch-Vile contains HOMs in the
                          building with the bridge when viewed in OpenGL
                          rendering modes.  These are mandatory, as fixing
                          them would otherwise ruin the bridge effect in
                          software renderers.  It also features no music
                          whatsoever, but this was intentional; it was a
                          decision on the author's part, and is not an
                          oversight.
                          
                          Several maps also contain sky transfer specials,
                          introduced by the port Marine's Best Friend,
                          which do not work in Boom; at the time they were
                          designed, PrBoom and its brethren allowed sky
                          transfers under Boom compatibility.  This is
                          merely a cosmetic issue, though, and does not
                          affect gameplay.  Apart from this, there are no
                          other incompatibilities.
May Not Run With...     : Doom2.exe, or any port that isn't
                          Boom-compatible
