Story                   :

You're in deep shit. You didn't realize that those rates on "SchlongFest.com" were per-minute, not per-month. That's another few thousand dollars to add to the money you owe to that guy who you borrowed a couple of bucks from... and lost several high-stakes poker games to... and whose car you managed to get to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean and his insurance didn't cover international waters. You promised each time you'd get him the money you owed him. 

It's pay time now, and you haven't got a single cent to your name. You know this guy and the kind of stuff he does to people who owe him. But he decides to let you off scot-free if you do him a favor or two - just find some stuff for him and he'll let you go. If you decide not to do that... well, you don't value your kneecaps that much, do you?

So off you go, to find his stuff. You can't help but feel this is a needless journey that will put you in unnecessary danger.  Yes, it's a long and tedious quest. Yes, it's dangerous, filled with monsters, demons, and sexual perverts. Yes, it's an immense waste of time to go get trinkets when you could be heading for the border. But consider the alternative. He's got friends in lots of places and you won't get ten feet away without someone of his noticing. So it's best for your health to just trudge off to begin your search, hoping that you'll finish this quest in mostly one piece...
