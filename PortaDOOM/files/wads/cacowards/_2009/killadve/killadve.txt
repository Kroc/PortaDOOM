Misc. Author Info       : 23 year old dude from Thailand, ladyboy. I have a
                          girlfriend and love playing doom2. We get a lot
                          of  overseas tourists to our country. 

Description             : This is an all new a 32 level episode for doom2.
                          You must adventure through many unique worlds
                          killing awful monsters along the way. When you
                          play this in Zdoom you get all the level names. I
                          learnt how to use mapinfo, add new textures and
                          add new music. The first 11 levels are on the
                          ground and then you go into space before heading
                          into a vivid colorful world of beauty. Many arch
                          guys and barons and blue enemies and demons will
                          try and stop you but you have plenty of firepower
                          to protect you. It took me 4 months to make this
                          and I back this up on my memory card everytime I
                          made a level. Thailand monsoon lightning struck
                          powerline and my laptop was fried but got it
                          replace with warranty. After that I finish off the
                          Killing Adventure and I drew the pictuers and the
                          titlepic and got it scanned at my cousins house.
                          Took me 3 hours to figure out but got it into
                          doom finaly. I hope you enjoy the killing
                          adventure and I also made the skys too.
