----------------------
2. REQUIREMENTS
----------------------

Whispers of Satan is designed to run under a Boom Compatible Sourceport. It will not run under
Doom2.exe due to its limits and features. To play WOS you have to download one of the following source ports.

MINIMUM

- The Doom 2 Game (Doom2.wad)
- TeamTNT's Boom Engine (www.teamtnt.com) although we reccomend Prboom.

RECOMENDED

- Zdoom by Randy Heit (www.zdoom.org) - Enables a few additional animated textures and flats to assure
you get the full experience and play Whispers of Satan to its full abillities.

Downloading these sourceports guarantees that this wad will run and you'll get many weeks of challenging enjoyment.


---------------
3. INSTALLATION
---------------

Firstly you'll need a copy of the game Doom 2 by id software installed on your PC. This is required
since WOS will not run standalone.

Unzip WOS.WAD into your Doom2 directory. If you've downloaded Zdoom. Drag WOS.WAD into 
the ZDOOM.EXE icon and select Doom2.wad. With Boom please use the -file parameter to play this wad
or unzip WOSBOOM.BAT into your Doom2 directory along with WOS.WAD and click on WOSBOOM.BAT. If you
have downloaded Prboom unzip WOSPBOOM.BAT and click on that. Make sure that Boom.exe or Prboom.exe
is in your doom2 directory.

If you are using DOS to run Whispers of Satan. Go into your doom2 directory and type boom -iwad 
doom2.wad -file wos.wad and press ENTER

4. STORY
------------
                          The year is 5765. You are marine who
                          works at the Union Aerospace Corporation (UAC), a
                          hidden complex amongst the highlands in Norway,
                          who also has facilities on Mars. You are sitting
                          at your desk doing assignments and you can feel a
                          rumble. The UAC's past history hasn't been a
                          very pleasant one. With Earth been invaded before
                          in the past. Hundreds of years of research has
                          unlocked a mysterious path into the unknown where
                          nobody has ever been before. UAC control detects
                          the bad news, lives are lost, life is becoming
                          more precious.
                           
                          A flaming skull is caught in mid-air by 3
                          bullets, fires break out and quite simply hell is
                          breaking loose which is perhaps the biggest cause
                          of a dramatic global warming over the past 100
                          years. Perhaps there was hellspawn left over from
                          the previous invasion buried deep underground
                          which thousands of years later managed to dig
                          itself out. You strap on your BFG, blast a
                          Cacodemon out of your way and proceed.
                          
                          After a long cold struggle the marine passes
                          into the teleport and finds himself stranded in a
                          blistering inferno, fire and brimstone full of
                          advanced demonic technology and a scorching sun
                          so close that you can reach out and touch it.
                          Those amazing Breathtaking views of hell don't
                          come with ease. The monsters come in from all
                          direction. Luckily a large amount of weapons and
                          ammo are teleported in to help the marine thanks
                          to the advanced technology achieved over the past
                          several millennia and armor is so tough these
                          days you can survive the hits and bumps.
                          
                          Reaching Deep within the depths of darkness is a
                          tough assignment. Running past the Viles of hell
                          and passing through the fire while an evil voice
                          constantly whispers away at you. It is not a cool
                          experience. At the end of your long journey you
                          encounter the beast.  And as you unlock the gate
                          and pump your rockets into its sorry brain, hell
                          is a wreck forever and you vanish back to the
                          friendly environment of your home world.
