Description             : After the release of "Cheogsh", the ideas of 
                          what should be included in it have appeared; and
                          the number of those ideas was so big – that the 
                          thought of making Cheogsh 2 have appeared by 
                          itself. But initial concept of the wad, around 
                          which this wad was meant to be built, hasn’t 
                          justified itself – this has predetermined long
                          and uneasy destiny of all project. As a result,
                          Cheogsh 2 came out not so epic, as it was meant
                          to be initially. But we hope despite that, this 
                          wad did not become less interesting. Thanks all
                          who helped us while we were working on it.

                          To play Cheogsh 2, type the following command in
                          Start-Run:
                          gzdoom.exe -file cheogsh2.pk3

                          You also can regulate speed of messages in 
                          dialogues  -  T button by default.   Volcanoes 
                          effects can  be  turned  on/off  by pressing 
                          U button. Also, an alternative HUD is 
                          recommended to be used.
                          Have a good game!
