Description             : World War III ended with massive use of biological
                          weaponry. 99% of Earth population died almost 
                          immediately. Remaining people who were immune hid
                          themselves in underground shelters escaping from the 
                          individuals who also survived but went completely 
                          insane. 50 years later your "family" received 
                          an unreadable radio transmission from a nearby town.
                          You were sent to investigate...
