                          deathz0r for being useless.  Essel for doing
                          too much work.  Cato for assembling.  Mech
                          for the bigfont.  Shai for general art shit.

Bonus Pontification     : Hey sup this is Shai and I delayed the release
                          of this wad for like a couple of weeks because I
                          said I wanted to write a text file.  So now that
                          I'm writing it I have nothing to say except
                          maybe that Impboy sucks really hard and we
                          probably shouldn't accept his maps anymore for
                          YEDS related projects.  Also stay tuned for
                          bitching new YEDS projects that are slated for
                          release in 2008, including Diet 32in24, Greenwar
                          2, and 32in24-8 through 10.
