NOTES on Map08-10 Hub:

1. The hub starts on Map08.
2. To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDCLEV cheat code to warp to any 
   of the maps. Doing so will mess up the scripts and will leave you stuck 
   in the map to which you warp. [You can warp to a map just to look around 
   if you wish.]
3. To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDCLIP cheat code to leave the 
   intro area or the hub area in Map08. Doing so will mess up the scripts 
   and will leave you stuck in the map.
4. To ensure proper gameplay do not use the IDKFA cheat code to get weapons. 
   Doing so could mess up the scripts and will leave you stuck in the map 
   in which you used the cheat code.  [This is particularly true of the 
   chainsaw, as once you've gotten it through the cheat code you cannot pick 
   it up in the map. This could prevent you from being able to leave the map.]




SPOILER ALERT: Read the remaining part of this text file only if you are stuck
and cannot make progress. Otherwise, please play the maps solely based on the 
information provided by the in-game text messages.




The objectives of the 3-map hub are presented during the optional introduction.
However, here they are again:

1. You can choose to enter any of the 3 maps from the hub area.
2. In the first map that you enter you will need to pick up all 3 weapons 
   before you can exit that map.
3. In each of the 3 maps you must find a runic symbol switch and turn it on. 
   Doing so will allow you access to the Chamber of Eternal Rest in Map08.
4. Enter the Chamber of Eternal Rest in Map08 and pick up the plasma rifle. 
   This will give you the access code to turn off the laser barrier in the hub.
5. Return to the hub using the vertical portal in Map08.
6. Turn off the laser barrier and exit.
