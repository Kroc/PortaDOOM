Description            : Urban Brawl is the prequel to 
			 Scuba Steve's: Action Doom, telling your 
			 character's history before those events.  
			 Urban Brawl embodies a comic book look and
			 feel with cell shaded graphics and story 
			 sequences.  All of this is fused with a 
			 gameplay that is reminicent of an old 
			 beat-em up game.

Story                  : Ten years before the events of the 
			 Uac Site 4 disaster, you are a former 
			 law enforcement officer, laid off, drunk, 
			 miserable, and raising your daughter alone.
			 When contract killers kidnap your daughter,
			 it's time for action.

 * Construction *

Base                    : From Scratch, using several modified 
			  resources from the original Action Doom.

Editor(s) used          : Wintex, Doom Builder, Paint Shop Pro 6, 
			  Photoshop 7, WadAuthor, XWE and 
			  Pencil/Ink/Paper
			  
Build time              : July '04 - July '08 : 4 years

Fixes			: None
			  
Known Bugs              : In Map 01 you can get stuck climbing the 
			  fire escape ladder, you'll have to 
			  clipcheat to get out.  This is a result
			  of Doom's buggy movement code and cannot
			  be fixed.  To avoid clipping errors, walk
			  straight up the stairs on their right side.

			  It is possible to not be able to pick up
			  candy and pop that vending machines drop.
			  To avoid this, stand back as far away as 
			  possible from the machine and break it .

			  There are numerous rendering errors due to
			  the extensive use of portals and 3d mid
			  textures.  There may be HOMs and 
			  slimetrails in a number of places.  I've
			  tried to minimize them so they are not 
			  egregious... but you may see them from 
			  time to time
