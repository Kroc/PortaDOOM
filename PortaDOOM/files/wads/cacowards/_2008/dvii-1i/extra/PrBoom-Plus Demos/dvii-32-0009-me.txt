OK, This demo here took a lot of practiance and patiense!
Well over 200 hundred tries!

As you start recording, make sure you don't blink your eyes,
otherwise you might lose a second of time!

Make sure you side run straight to teh gauntlets, and pay no
attention to that meanie eye 'o sauron who wants to slow you!

As you come back out, run forward, grabs teh gauntlets, and face your
greatest F.E.A.R, the archvilE!!!111 Make sure you attack him, otherwise 
he'll leave third degree burns all over your body. As you attack, make sure 
you don't lost sight of him, or he might waste your time! As he dies, turn 
around and run off teh cliff into lava pool of death to continuE, as the 
screen changes, make sure you get 100% everything, including time! Othewise 
it's not Uv-max0r!

Kicking ass and chewing bubble gum,
