Description:

Short and sweet opening map (at least it used to be the first map when I recorded
the demo). Not too hard and fairly simple route-wise. There's more to choosing
when to use the small supply of rockets and cells than picking where to go next.
The YK area can be a problem if you're low on health and the chaingunners get nasty.
The final secret can also be deadly if you make one wrong move in the HK hallway.
A first exit with a sub-5 time was enough for me, so it's still improvable.
