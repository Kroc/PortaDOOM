Description:

I never thought I'd see a slaughter map without any health or ammo ;)

Infights are of key importance so I focus on making all the cybers get
their share of action before leaving the citadel. Surprisingly enough 
lost monsters are a rarity here despite the large number of zombiemen
and imps that can wander around. I clear the outside and use the invuln
to get back inside. The time depends heavily on the number of imps that
get killed during the infights.

4th exit, started with a weak 3:00 before I realized I was wasting the
cybers up on the walls by leaving the courtyard too quickly before they
had a chance to attack the revs. This time most of the imps on the walls
were dead so I managed to push it under 2:30 which was my goal.
