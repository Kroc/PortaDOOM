Misc. Author Info       : I'm Canadian, eh?
Description             : You have been transported to a Mars laboratory to
                          eradicate the hellspawn threat. The fourth rock
                          from the Sun had been terraformed decades earlier
                          to provide an isolated environment for classified
                          experiments. It is your task to destroy every
                          lifeform on the premises and get off the planet.
Additional Credits to   : - Lee Szymanski, Bill "Bloodshedder" Koch,
                            Jonathan Rimmer, Jonathan Dowland, and
                            "Scuba Steve" Browning for playtesting.
                          - Matt Dixon for creating the cramped hallway
                            just beyond the red/blue key access barriers.
