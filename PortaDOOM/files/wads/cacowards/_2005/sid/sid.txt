Other Files By Author   : A bunch.
Misc. Author Info       : Finnish doom freak.

Description             : A set of four levels, which all push the limits of
			  the good ol' vanilla Doom. 

			  If your computer refuses to cooperate with doom2.exe,
			  I recommend Chocolate Doom:
			  http://chocolate-doom.sourceforge.net/

			  Has also been tested and found functional on ZDoom. Other
			  ports may or may not break some effects. I really don't
			  recommend playing this on a 3D-accelerated port.


Additional Credits to   : Authors of the editors I have used, especially CodeImp.
			  If I was still stuck using WadEd, this wad would not
			  be what it is now.

			  Thanks to Lüt as well; for testing, inspiration
			  and kicking me to finish this thing.
