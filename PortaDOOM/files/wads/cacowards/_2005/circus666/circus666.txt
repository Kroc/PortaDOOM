Credits:	 	1. CodeImp for DooMBuilder, all the other guys who made the other programs I used.

                 	2. Cutmanmike, who made ghoul.wad. Pennywise the Dancing Clown (head) was
                           inspired by that guy's monster. 
						
			3. The movie "IT", for reasons that will be obvious once you play.

                        4. My brother for giving me the idea to make a circus level that would scare
                           little kids.	

			5. http://www.findsounds.com/types.html for some sound samples.	

			6. Cheesy 'B' horror movies.



Descrption:             Circus/carnival themed ZDoom map. Great for little kids. No original monsters used.

Known bugs:            1. Some parts might run slow.
                       2. Theres a part where you have to kill 3 clown heads (the ones that shoot missiles),
                          its possible that if you kill 2 or 3 at once the 'if' statement will only run 1 or 2 times
                          when it needs to run 3 times to lower a floor all the way down. You can't progress further
                          unless its down.

Tips:

	1. When fighting Pennywise, keep moving. You can't run from him but you can atleast make it harder for
           him to bite you.
	2. When you see an invulnerability sphere in the arena use it. More will spawn in.
	3. Using the chaingun on large groups of possessed balloons works well.
	4. Use the rocket launcher of the jumping skulls when possible, they're hard to hit with chainguns and shotguns.
