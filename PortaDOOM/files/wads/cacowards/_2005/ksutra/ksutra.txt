[1.2 Resources used]

KS was compiled with textures from the following sources:
Heretic & Hexen by Raven Software
Final Doom by Team TNT / id Software
Ultimate Doom by id Software
Alien Vendetta - STEPTOP2 by Kim Malde


[1.3 Additional graphics]

only a few texts written on walls 
...Our graphic skills you could see on TITLE picture :)



[1.4 Midi music]

We weren't able to compose some new track so we used some our favourite 
MIDI tracks from these sources:
Ultimate Doom: 02,11
Doom2: 03
Alien Vendetta: 18
Requiem: 25
Heretic: 05,19,21,23
Duke Nukem 3D: 01,04,06,09,13,15,20,29,inter
Rise of the Triad: 06,07,08,10,14,16,17,26,32,read me
TNT: 12,22,31,tittle
+
Metallica: 24,28
Led Zeppelin: 27
Mr.M. Jackson: 10
Lemmings: 30

[1.5 Gameplay] 

KS was made for original doom2.exe, it wasn't tested on the ports
so we couldn't reccomend them. For example there are woodoo dolls
on a few maps and so on.

We focused on gameplay on Skill 4. Lower skills are implemented too,
but we haven't tested them much.
COOP on skill 4 was tested a bit so it should go well.
DM is involved but not tested, there aren't any special DM arenas in
the maps, but I guess some maps could be good for DM though..
for example 01,03,07,17,27. Anyway I doubt anybody will ever try 
them :)

You just have to go and find every good firing position to embrace well...:)


---------------------
[3] LEVEL INFORMATION
---------------------

Map01 - "Into the Underground" (Adolf Vojta/Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
When the project was at its beginning, Method took my old map 
originally made for Doom1 and retextured it and added some details.
Then later on I took this map again and completed. We wanted to have
the first map simple and not so overdetailed.


Map02 - "The Hidden Engine" (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
A small indoor map done by Method himself. It's one of our very few maps
reminding good old doom1 techbases.


Map03 - "Mr.Adolf Kill You!" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Another one old small map I like. I included one special secret place
as a little joke :)


Map04 - "Water Base" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The very first map I made for doom2. You could see it looks older 
than most of the other ones, but I like it how it is so I decided
not to remake it up to date. Just let it stay...I still think it's
a good map. This map was inspirated by Chrozoron's map03 in HR2.


Map05 - "Klondike" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The map including about 3-4 wall textures and you see it's enough.
Start at the little brown cave inspirated by Dystopia3 and map11
from Alien Vendetta. Then you get out to surface and walk through
gray rocky mountains.. and that's all. Another special secret place
is included.



Map06 - "Research Complex" (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Another Method's nice techbase. I liked to play this one. Finally
you will meet first KS cybie.


Map07 - "Colosseum" (Adolf Vojta/Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
It's a remake of my old map made originally for doom1. One of the maps 
I became addicted on. Thanks to Method for an assistence towards the
end.



Map08 - "Time is Tickin' Out" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Light effects - that's the basic idea this map is aimed at. So you
could see on the exit square how the day is running from afternoon 
to evening.


Map09 - "The Holocaust" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The second map I made, another old map I decided to stay in the original
shape which is focused more on gameplay then on design. And the gameplay
is surely the main thing.


Map10 - "To Be or Not To Be..." (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Method says: "OK!"


Map11 - "Execution" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
A red-cave map inspired by Erik ALm's Scythe episode3, I just added my
own ellements. At the end I added one cybie in front of exit. I think
it is a great place for him.


Map12 - "King Arena" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Third and the last map I took from my original mapset for doom1. It went
through many design changes but the main things stayed in the same way.
It's a tyson map including only SSG for the end and also some puzzles
I am proud of.


Map13 - "The Holocaust II" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
It's a city-cross map looking like a harder sequel of Map09. I like it.


Map14 - "Dog Eat Dog" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
I wanted to have some map with some big height differences, so...
this one grew up. I surely had to reduce design and light effects
so the main thing here to aim at was some good gameplay. I hope it
turned out well..


Map15 - "Miss Sporty" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
I comprised many ideas to this map.. places for sport all the time
and the old-town exit. I made this map SSG-only and some BFG shots 
for the end.



Map16 - "Leeds Castle" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
One of my older maps I really like the outlay. I used to plan this map
it for doom1, but this doom2 result seems quite better that I expected.
Once again thanks Method he gave me the Wadauthor :)


Map17 - "Cyber Machine" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The map inspired by HR2 map09. But it's probably my most unique map 
though. It will need some patience to complete so it could be boring for 
somebody but I decided to let the gameplay be done this way. 


Map18 - "The Train is Approaching" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
For this map I let inspired myself by AV maps 06 & 24 by Lee and Fish.
Both of them are an excellent map with an excellnent design. I tried to
do a map similar to these but I did a layout with many ways and possible
routes to complete. At the start you really don't know where to go so
you have to just walk away and seek.


Map19 - "Natural" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Hmmm my own map I really don't like :) I don't know why. I just decided
to use it because it has some gameplay ideas I haven't used in other maps
and the design.. is also pretty different from the other ones.. so at the
end it's maybe not so bad map..


Map20 - "Traps" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The tittle hints something.. expect some nice traps when you will go through
this map. The gameplay seems to be more than easy at the start but then will
suddenly come a good cauldron. Luckily I decided to give there an Invul :)


Map21 - "Diablo's Heart" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
The second red-cave map but slightly harder than map11 :) And also pretty
different gameplay. For some time you have no weapons and you have to reach 
them in a pacifist-way. Then most of cells are placed at the exit so
then you could finally go back and kill most of the cratures which 
annoyed you all the time :)
And I think it's my only map without SSG...


Map22 - "Fire Play" (Jakub Razak/Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Method's "only 2004 work" :) but pretty good one. It was based on an
interesting fights with not much place to move but the map looks large though.
My work on this map became after final yellow bars and ended at the exit hall. 
That part just needed to increase :)



Map23 - "A Little Big Massacre" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Everytime I played the first part of Heretic E1M4 I thought it could be a good
typical monsters crowded map for doom. So this map is a remake. The gameplay
I focused on many monsters they could randomly roaming through the buildings
so it could be hard to catch all monsters withoud sound. That means this map could 
be played in many ways. 
I remember when I completed it and let Method to play it I surely expected he will
quickly die at the yellow key, there are 5 cybies followed by 80 revenants..
He killed them all on the first try and said "..average fight" 
OMG what more do I have to add to kill him finally :)  



Map24 - "The Gift From GOTT" (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Method's first map including some mixed features. He made the map you have to
play cautiously and when you don't have guns or enough ammo (like at the start)
you just have to find another strategy to mop up all monsters because you don't
have a chance to run away to some safe place. Because there is no safe place
prepared for you. It's not so common in KS.

  

Map25 - "Cow Face" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
I thought I would do a map similar to HR map 25, but the result seems rather 
different and Radeg said it reminds HR map 32. So it's probably inspired by
both of them. The name of the map is strange but when I watched it on the 
automap.. I saw there a face of cow so why not to use it as a title :)


Map26 - "Kill Bill" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
I wanted the map26 inspired by my own map25 but being bigger and harder. And
I think it was a good idea because I builded another map I am fully satisfied
with.


Map27 - "Stairway To Heaven" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
It's infact 8 maps situated in space connected into the one. In each part
you get one new weapon so you are beginning with pistol and berserk and
ending with BFG. And surely..the gameplay becomes harder and harder...but 
not so hard I think. In this map I aimed more at design so maybe the gameplay
suffer somewhere.. 
And it reminds eight minigolf holes in space.


Map28 - "Hard Target" (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Method wanted one map which would be very hard, inspirated by HR24 and have
more than 1000 monsters so I gave him a free hand. And.. it has over 1700
monsters at the end. Crazy map :)


Map29 - "I'm Just a DOOM Addict" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Everytime we wanted map29 a city-themed like in plutonia or scythe. I tried
to do it you go through the city lower and lower and it ends at the hell.
The gameplay shouldn't be too hard just enjoyable.. I just lose inspiration
for unique hard situations here :)


Map30 - "<|>" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Well, I was helding this idea in my mind for maybe a year... I was
still worried how could it end up, expected many visplanes HOMs and
so on. But the result looked .. very nice and even I was able to
complete the whole body without any big HOMs. (yes there are a few 
ones). It's perhaps the map I am most satisfied with :)
Note: Thanks to my ex-girlfried who gave me some inspiration :) 


Map31 - "Devastation" (Adolf Vojta)
*********************************************************
Comments:
This map is remaked great E1M5 from Heretic. We wanted some map 
reminding good old HR22 and then I suggested to Method that he could 
redo this one. Well, at the end I did the map myself probably harder
then I planned but we know there are players who could do it :)
About the design I let the map in the original shape, but I had to 
rebuild some buildings to have the design more simple. 
I still wonder if HR22 wasn't originally inspirated by the heretic
E1M5.


Map32 - "Anger Management" (Jakub Razak)
*********************************************************
Comments:
Method made this great map and I quickly became addicted on it. 
On the other side I don't remember if I ever completed it but I don't 
think it's a big problem :). Method took an inspiration from Doom
E4M8 I think.



--------
[4] BUGS
--------

* A port is needed in order to not override the save game buffer in the
  majority of the levels. Who use savegames nowadays anyway?

* There are slight HOMs on several maps. We decided to let them be
  so you will have to take over them.

* We had many Visplanes during the project so we are never 100% sure
  there is no one, so.. promise us if you will have a one (or two)
  Honestly we did everything to remove them.
 

---------------- 
[5] FUTURE PLANS
----------------

Well, my inspiration ended here for now, but in the future, if there
are some guys who want to work on some another project together, I am 
looking forward that we will build once Kama Sutra 2 at least :)

So seriously if you have an interest to work on something with me, 
pls email me <hita@seznam.cz>, because I doubt I will create 25 maps
once again...
