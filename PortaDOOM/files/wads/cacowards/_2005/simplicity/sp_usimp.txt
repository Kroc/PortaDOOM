NOTES:
===========================================================================

Here's a condensed list of what's been updated:

	* MAP01-MAP05 have been remade entirely from scratch. Some of the
	  maps were replaced entirely.

	* MAP06-MAP20 have had a varying amount of changes made to them.
	  some maps have had minor gameplay tweaks made to them, while
	  others have gone through major changes in which entire areas
	  were replaced.

	* The secret map has also had a TON of changes made to it. I'm not
	  about to spoil it, especially for those who've never played the
	  original version.

	* The WAD has been tested for full cooperative playability on both
	  Episode 1 and Episode 2, as well as the secret map.

	* Episode 3 - Director's Cut is provided as-is. The maps have not
	  been touched from their original versions (aside from some
	  script-related nonsense). They may or may not be cooperative
	  compatible.

	* Bacon. :D

	* Geez, I can't even remember what else. It's been so long that I
	  can hardly remember.

If you happen to notice any bugs at all, feel free to bug the crap out of
me via e-mail or otherwise until I fix it.

Also, I thought I'd note that there may be some slight errors with some of
the custom graphics (such as the TITLEMAP graphics, etc.) when using ZDoom 
2.1.7 (as opposed to the 2.1.8 SVN versions) due to usage of 24-bit PNG 
graphics. Why did I use 24-bit PNGs? I don't even know.
