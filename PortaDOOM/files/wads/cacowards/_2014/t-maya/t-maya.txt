Misc. Author Info       : 

Description             : Five maps, loosely Mayan in setting, with an assortment
			of DeHacked changes to alter monster behavior and a few other things.
			Notably, some monsters and projectiles are faster than their vanilla
			counterparts. If you typically play maps on UV, I would
			definitely recommend HMP for your first playthrough to avoid
			any potential frustration. Similarly, if you usually play on
			HMP by default, dropping the difficulty down to HNTR would probably
			be a good idea. UV is certainly doable on a first playthrough though,
			if you fancy yourself a challenge.

			MBF-compatible port is needed for play. (G)ZDoom recommended, but
			also designed to work in PrBoom+ at complevel 11.
			

Additional Credits to   : esselfortium, for making the Mayan textures (though based
			off of other textures) that make up 90% of the maps. IMX, for a number of
			sprite/graphic replacements, and for being an awesome and friendly dude. Plums,
			for extensively expanding and modifying the SKY1 texture, and also for being
			generally helpful and friendly. NMN and Eriance for a good portion of the
			other spritework. Many others for various contributions. See below for
			more specifics!

				A. PROJECT INFORMATION
===========================================================================

It might seem a little overkill for such a short map-set to have so much
junk written and included in the text-file, but as someone who *does*
enjoy reading other mapper's reflections on their own work, I figure
a few people might get some enjoyment out of some more technical/historical
knowledge, if a bit trivial.

All of these maps started out as speedmaps, not necessarily with a time
limit but with the goal to finish in "a few hours" or before the day had
ended. Doing things this way is good for me in that it distracts me from
thinking about the quality of what I'm making just enough to let me continue,
but on the other hand speedmapping can be a negative thing, too, because
you get less time to develop your ideas. With these maps, however, I've spent
a good amount of time refining both visuals and gameplay after the initial
"drafts" were completed, and in the end I no doubt spent many hours more
refining the maps than I did making their first iterations.

In the beginning, when all there was was MAP01, I had been inspired by D2XGold
to try and make some radical game behavior changes, like replacing the SSG with
a quadruple shotgun and upping monster health pretty significantly, but there
were more bad ideas in there than good ones, as a lot of people on Doomworld
noted when I first posted this. I reluctantly dialed things back after that,
but eventually the modifications became what they are now: a few significant
changes with mostly minor ones, preserving the game's core gameplay.
There are quite a few changes/things I wish Doom natively had, the most
important of which are included in this wad, to whatever extent MBF features
allowed. The inclusion of the Cyber Baron as a meaty but slow monster that
poses a larger threat even in open spaces is definitely crucial,
but I also grew pretty fond of the flying Mancubi after putting them in. All
other changes (such as monster/fireball speed) are done to generally make
monsters more threatening individually/in small numbers.

There are a number of things that I approached differently when designing
these maps compared to my previous ones. Most obvious is the organic layouts,
but I also experimented more with damaging floors as well as large outdoor areas.
The tree sprites no doubt make me a lot more attracted to the idea of doing
outdoor scenes, as vanilla really has no stock decoration that looks
natural without also being twisted and hellish.

Quick note about the palette. It's based on Sigvatr's "PalPlus" palette, but
I ended up changing most of the palette myself, so very little of PalPlus
remains. The changes in the greens, reds, and blues (now purple)
were initially inspired by the retro-futuristic images on some of the
covers of Perturbator's albums, and I had intended (and attempted) to make a
dystopian-themed mapset with pretty, glowy colored lights all over the place.
Didn't get very far obviously. Most of the colors that aren't green/red/blue
I reverted back to their Doom 2 palette defaults, but there are still a few
remnants of PalPlus in there.

				B. MAPPING NOTES
===========================================================================

Title & Intermission music: "Pokey Pipes" from Donkey Kong Country 3,
by Eveline Fischer and David Wise

===================
MAP01: Mayan Mishap
===================
Music: "Cascade Capers" from Donkey Kong Country 3, by Eveline Fischer and David Wise
Initial build date: around March 16 2014
Initial build time: all day; ~10 hours maybe?

This map started out as some paper sketches of what eventually became the main
resurrecting-Manc room and the big open ditch room to the south. I spent the next
day turning it into a finished product, though there are a few key differences between
the initial iteration and what's there now. A lot of visual detail came later, the
open space behind the player's start didn't exist, and the area in the north end
of the map by the white key teleport was essentially just... a big open room
filled with monsters.

This is probably my favorite of the pack; I'm attached to it since it was the first,
and Cascade Capers is no doubt my favorite DKC tune.

===================
MAP02: Sacrificial Scramble
===================
Music: "Cavern Caprice" from Donkey Kong Country 3, by Eveline Fischer and David Wise
Initial build date: around March 22 2014
Initial build time: ~4 hours

Other than all the visual updates, the most significant differences between this
version and the initial iteration are the starting area in the caves, and the
area in the northwest corner of the map, past the altar battle. The caves at
the beginning are structurally about the same, but initially the gameplay wasn't
as intentional as it is now. The northwest area was formerly a much smaller room
that connected the altar room to the large, outdoor northern area. 

===================
MAP03: Demon Dance
===================
Music: "Frosty Frolics" from Donkey Kong Country 3, by Eveline Fischer and David Wise
Initial build date: April 3 2014
Initial build time: ~3 hours

This one had probably the shortest initial development time. If I recall correctly,
my motivation dimmed pretty quickly after starting this one, so unlike map01 and 02,
it kind of turned into just an exercise in "getting it done." Most of this was
because I wasn't really sure how to tackle doing the map's gameplay based on the
rather linear, open layout I'd made. The Cyberdemons were a late addition when
I played the map again after a long break and felt it was still lacking. Not a whole
lot differs between the first and final versions; not a whole lot of substance
to the map, so not a whole lot to spruce up.

===================
MAP04: Temple Terror
===================
Music: "Crystal Chasm" from Donkey Kong Country 3, by Eveline Fischer and David Wise
Initial build date: August 20 2014
Initial biuld time: ~6 hours

I got overly ambitions when I started making this one... my initial plan was for all
areas to be visible out the windows of other areas, with expansive, tree-filled vistas
in between each of the little hilltop temples, but the visible area got too large and
started causing technical problems. On top of that, it was difficult to make things look
sufficiently pretty with such a huge space, so in the end I cut all that out and just
stuck each area in its own tree bowl. This is my attempt at a more arena-style
of play, dumping you into tough situations and forcing you to act quickly
to avoid a dozen fireballs in your face.

===================
MAP31: Crystal Basin
===================
Music: "The Glass Facade" by basehead, taken from modarchive.org
Initial build date: around November 11 2011
Initial build time: ~6 hours

I have a handful of maps from around 2011 that have gone through a few stages
of refinement over the last few years but had never made it to a releasable state.
This was one of the maps in that handful (another was turned into MAP02 of
BtSX Episode 2). Before I overhauled this in July of this year, the cave
was brown rather than grey/green, and all the non-cave bits were tan brick
and metal, rather tech-basey, and the liquid was all lava. The purple and green
came about after deciding to fit the map to this set's resources, though
there was actually a time when I intended to adopt a similar purple/green scheme
using BtSX textures and use this map there (it was denied, understandably, for
already having been semi-released on the Doomworld forums, among other things).
There are two other maps, one also from November 2011 and another more recent
2013 effort, that I started converting to this same purple gothic scheme,
but doing so felt like more trouble than I cared, so they remain unfinished
and unreleased. I would like to revisit this theme in the future, however.
