Known Bugs              : * Eternity:
                          - Small fan shadows aren't synchronized
                          * DOS Boom and MBF, WinMBF:
                          - A few rare textures are too tall for these
                          engines to display correctly; then again, music
                          won't work there anyway
                          * PrBoom+:
                          - If you're a weirdo who's using the jumping
                          feature for anything other than debugging - I
                          hope you like sky seams
