Description             : After Two successful...ish endeavors, the MAYhem crew is
			  back for its biggest, most ambitious, and closest to 
			  on time campaign yet!  (Everything said and done before July!)
                          As usual the maps were made in a one month time span 
			  (the month of May). Only this time, to commemorate the cultural
			  zeitgeist of the era, all the maps were confined to a 2048x2048
			  playing space, so years from now, we can look back on one of the
			  definitve passtimes of the early months of 2014!  While severerly
			  dating in execution, we on the MAYhem team hope this levelpack will
			  neverhtheless keep players entertained for a long time to come.

			  Welcome to MAYhem 2048!
