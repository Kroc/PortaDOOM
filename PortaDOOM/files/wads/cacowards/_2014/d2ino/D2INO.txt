Archive Maintainer      : One final problem. An old version of MAP12, using
                          a copy-pasted room from Doom II was still present
						  in the WAD. This update removes it.
Compatibility           : Vanilla/Chocolate Doom
Primary purpose         : Single play
===========================================================================
Title                   : Doom 2 In Name Only
Filename                : D2INO.wad
Release date            : 14 June 2014
Authors                 : Various, see below

Description             : Imagine a world where Doom II was never released,
                          and the only information that ever came to light
                          was the level titles. Then imagine that nearly 20
                          years later, some people decided to make some
                          levels based on how they interpreted the level
                          name. Those very levels are in this WAD file.

Known Bugs              : MAP07 relies on barrels killing "dummy Mancubi"
                          to trigger the tag 666 actions. In ZDaemon,
						  infinitely tall actors MUST be enabled, otherwise
						  the barrels will not kill the mancubi.
						  
						  There may be some sneaky tutti-fruttis.
						  While not bugs, you're bound to find some
						  misaligned textures on your travels.

Cannonball would like to thank mouldy for upgrading Doomguy's flight from
RyanAir to Virgin Atlantic. Unfortunately, the flight still ends in style
of the former, so you don't get to skip from MAP12 to 20. Sorry.
