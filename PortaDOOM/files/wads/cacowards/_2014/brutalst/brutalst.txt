Description             : Brutalist Doom is a WAD that retextures Doom to a
                          have a Brutalist architecture. From Wikipedia:

                          "Brutalist architecture is a movement in
                          architecture that flourished from the 1950s to
                          the mid-1970s, descended from the modernist
                          architectural movement of the early 20th century.
                          Brutalism became popular with governmental and
                          institutional clients. Examples are typically
                          massive in character (even when not large),
                          fortress-like, with a predominance of exposed
                          concrete construction."

                          Critics of the style have described it as
                          "cold-hearted", "inhuman", "hideous", and
                          "monstrous", and for projecting an atmosphere of
                          totalitarianism and urban decay. Brutalist Doom
                          recreates this atmosphere, primarily through the use
                          of a replacement TEXTURE1 resource, but also with a
                          custom dehacked patch, texture replacements and
                          a custom palette.

* Doom II Alternative Story *

Following your defeat of the Spider Mastermind, you step through a doorway and
emerge from hell to see the green fields of Earth!

Or at least, they were green fields, once. Three years have passed since you
were shipped off to the Martian moon bases, and in that time, Earth has been
undergoing its second industrial revolution. Under the banner of progress,
the almighty Union Aerospace Corporation has poisoned the atmosphere with
pollution and covered the Earth in an endless concrete jungle.

A nearby pool of blood (there are no rabbits any more) reveals that you're not
the only one who came through the portal. The demons have already come
through before you and begun their invasion of Earth en masse. Facing
overwhelming odds, your outlook is bleak, but it's a bleakness tempered by the
knowledge that the UAC has already ruined the planet anyway. Even if you do
manage save Earth, it might not even have been worth saving.

* Theme *

Thematically, Brutalist Doom represents not only the literal architectural
style of exposed concrete for which brutalism is well known, but also attempts
to reproduce the emotional sensation of stark hopelessness that it
projects. Brutalism is perhaps emblematic of a repetitiveness and monotony
found in modern western society; an architectural expression of a wider
totalitarian philosophy that emphasizes soullessness, corporate consumerism
and materialism.

Doom is a game where players fight monsters from hell, but it has been said
that hell is this same sense of repetition and monotony:

  He said it was again the beginning of the unfinished, the re-discovery of
  the familiar, the re-experience of the already suffered, the
  fresh-forgetting of the unremembered. Hell goes round and round. In shape
  it is circular and by nature it is interminable, repetitive and very
  nearly unbearable.
   -- Flann O'Brien, "The Third Policeman"

Brutalist Doom expresses this through repetitive gray concrete textures,
almost all of which look identical. Doomguy is trapped in an endless,
featureless maze where every wall appears the same. Is this a world anyone
would want to save? Monotone hues are accentuated by a dehacked patch that
removes the color from many sprites: monsters, decorations, even barrels
have had their contents reduced to a blank monotone.

In the world of Brutalist Doom there is no music and almost no color: the
palette is replaced by a heavily saturated version, simulating senses
dulled from the monotony of a Kafkaesque nightmare. In a telling sign, the
saturation can occasionally fade - albeit briefly - when acquiring new
"things" (consumerist propaganda in effect), when experiencing pain
(whether caused by others or self-inflicted), or under the influence of
drugs (those berserk pack stims at least do something).
