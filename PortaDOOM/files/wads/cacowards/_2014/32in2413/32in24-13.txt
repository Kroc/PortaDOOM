Description             : "The year is 2007. Dimmy Waywes' Bickabedia
                          Fownndown is in hot water, and it's up to the
                          legendary Yeoman Engineers and Designers of
                          Software to save them the only way they know
                          how. With the power of soul food.
                          
                          Everything was set. The banquet was laid out,
                          and all there was left to do was set out the
                          traditional Thanksgiving burgers to appease the
                          almighty Map God.
                            
                          And then tragedy struck.
                            
                          It all happened in slow motion. Xaser strode up
                          confidently with a platter of burgers, but
                          Clonedpickle let the bottle of Frank's Red Hot
                          sauce slip, and it rolled under Xaser's foot. He
                          tumbled over dramatically, landing tongue-deep in
                          the stromboli. And in a glistening ark, all the
                          condiments went flying. Rings of onions dancing
                          in the air as if they belonged to a circus
                          magician, dewy, juicy leaves of romaine, thick
                          melted strands of cheddar, and mighty slabs of
                          ground and peppered angus.
                            
                          The burgers hit the floor.
                            
                          And the rest is history."

                          level that was submitted as an update after the
                          original release because "deal with it, it's not
                          on idgames yet :P", even though the reason it
                          wasn't was because idgames/ was read-only at the
                          time. Consider this one an idgames/ release bonus!
