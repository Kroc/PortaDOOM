Description             : Something sinister is lurking in UAC
                          headquarters. Grab your gun, head to the roof and
                          shoot your way down through the building to get
                          to the bottom of the mystery.
                          
                          This is a 32 map Doom 2 megawad - boom format,
                          complevel 9. Each map is a floor, each floor has
                          a lift, each lift needs a key. You'll work it out
                          I'm sure, just keep going down.
                          
                          These are small, fairly hard maps with high
                          body-counts, and gameplay I would describe as
                          'chaotic-evil'. The music tracks are my own
                          compositions which you may use with appropriate
                          credits, here is a track list:
