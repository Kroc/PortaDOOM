Description             :Updated version of White2.wad with some
                            bug fixes such as crashed blue door on map23 in
                           PrBoom+ format.
                             
                           Megawad, based on the results of a four 
                          speedmapping contests, held on www.iddqd.ru in 
                          2013, with such themes, as winter, thaw, 
                          precipices, and ancient civilizations.
                          Maps were finalized some time later (some - very
                          significantly), and several maps were built from
                          scratch.
                          This megawad tells us the fate of the Marine, who
                          was going to celebrate the New Year.
                          Suddenly, however, the monsters changed seasons'
                          offset, and as a result - they stole the winter. 
                          We have to go through the mountains, castles and
                          underground crypts, visit the flooded city, 
                          a lonely island and even visit the hell's edge
                          before it will be possible to restore the normal
                          course of the seasons.
                          But monsters were prepared for that as well - and
                          with the return of winter, they prepared some
                          unpleasant surprises...
