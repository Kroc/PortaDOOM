[1] INTRODUCTION
----------------

  Resurgence is a 32 maps megawad project, an upgrade from the unfinished
  Surge project. The maps are similar to Speed of Doom, ranging from
  Scythe/Plutonia-like maps to Speed of Doom to Resurgence-unique. The
  difficulty is considerably less in places but there are several
  challenging maps to plow through with the occasional slaughtermaps.
  (For those who don't like slaughter, avoid Map11,25,27,28,30)
  Sizes vary greatly (for the sake of variety), ranging from quick paced
  maps lasting 5 minutes to a long grind that could last even an hour. The
  project took about a year to complete. Surge was originally a month, and
  Resurgence took 7 months of non-stop work, 5 months hiatus and then a
  month of intensive sessions. The Surge maps that has not been heavily
  modified are Map05,13,14. Although not everyone will like all maps,
  hopefully this megawad offers several things that can be appreciated and
  also offers fun and challenges (I am looking at you demo-recording speed-
  runners...).

  This WAD is meant to be hard and challenging. Gameplay have been
  tested thoroughly- it is tough as nails, but fairness is guaranteed.

  Jump-strafing (run+sidestrafe) is required in several sections of
  this megawad.

[1.1 Compatibility]

  Resurgence is designed to be BOOM Compatible so it should run
  on BOOM source ports derivatives at least. It will crash on several maps
  if you try to run with BOOM or MBF. Glboom or Prboom-plus is recommended.

[1.2 Resources]
 
   - Textures were taken from:
      + CC4 Texture Packs
      + Some textures and colour palette (from 32in24 series) designed by
        Michael Mancuso (Esselfortium)
      + All three episode skies made by Brett Harrell (Mechadon)

   - New graphics were made by:

      + Brett 'Mechadon' Harrell : Fonts, Status bar, Titlepic
                                   Intermission pic, Credits, Bossback
                                   (Titlepic and interpic source images
				    made by Joshy but made even more
				    awesomer by Mechadon)


        Editors used: GIMP, Photoshop, XWE, SLumpEd, and Imagetool

[1.3 Midi Music]

   Music in Resurgence was mostly composed by:

   Stuart Rynn (aka stewboy, forty-two):
	Map09,10,12,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,29,31

   John Weekley (aka PRIMEVAL):
	Map06,07,13,30
        Introduction- "Demon Surge"
        Intermission- "A Victory Earned"
        Read Message- "Demon Resurged"

   ** You may use these Midi tracks provided that you give credit to the
   composer and the project 'Resurgence'. **

   All other music are from other sources such as Heretic, Doom, and vgmusic
  (Check map info for more details)

[2] STORY
---------

   Story? What story? Hell decided to come back resurging from the darkness
   without end just to annoy you for the second time. Waking up from
   the most nourishing sleep, you mutter 'Oh, not again! Where's my shotgun
   and vaseline?'


----------------
[3] INSTALLATION
----------------

  Simply either drag drop resurgence.wad onto a source port executable (i.e. Zdoom or Prboom).
  Alternatively you can type into the command line:

  " boom -iwad doom2.wad -file resurgence.wad "
  
  If you aren't using boom, replace boom with the name of your source port of choice.

                      Naturally, as it was not exactly up to par with the other maps,
                      it was rejected. After retexturing and redesigning several areas
                      due to Boom's flexibility, it fits nicely in Resurgence.

Authors comments    : This should hopefully be a better tyson map than Speed of Doom
		      Map21 was. I know the map21 tyson idea is overused but it is a
                      very useful way of ensuring variety, especially when Map17-20
                      is quite ammo/monster heavy. Also, don't worry if you don't have
                      ammo when you face the afrit, this is intentional and there's a
                      perfectly simple way of bypassing the afrit.

[Answer to Map31 Imitation + Post Mortem]

Joshy's postmortem of imitating Xaser:

Map name: Festering Wicked Helix Sectors

What can I say... Xaser is a very unique mapper, and from what I see, he seems to never
experience a shortage of original, innovative, and unorthodox ideas that ranges from intricate
or simple vanilla maps to zdoom maps brimming with awesome features within.
Considering that he is very talented in many aspects of doom mapping, I figured that the
starting point is to be selective with certain maps, just to ensure minimal confusion in
knowing what to imitate.

So, by being selective, I could truly pick out the styles inherent in the few maps, and
just follow/imitate the ongoing traits I found. The Xaser maps I used as references
were the two PRCP maps (Helix, and Wicked Garden), the 'Sector' map in some Zdoom community
project, and 'Underneath a Festering Moon' in BTSX Episode 2.

What particularly stood out for me in these maps were the consistent unorthodox shapes of
architectures and sectors: quite often, you do not really see a lot of symmetry. More so,
there are plenty, plenty of height differences visible within his fondness of stairs and
towering architectures. As I thought it'd be foolish to completely imitate his maps (or
maybe that was a way of excusing myself from the hard work), I decided to map in a way that
it'd come as 'what would happen if Joshy and Xaser maps make babbies?', and to try to avoid my usual
mapping tricks as much as I can. Whenever I ran into mapping blockage, I just did what I
would have done in a typical mapping session.

The overall layout is similar to Wicked Garden- there are two main plutonia-like layouts: one with
blood, and the other one drained of blood, with a more ominous feel. The player travels to the other
layout via some sort of time-travelling teleport as was the case in Wicked Garden. The giant tower
was inspired from Helix and Underneath a Festering Moon: That the player could see the tower at the
start, but reaches it eventually. The helix-like structure is an obvious inspiration, albeit it spirals
downwards compared to the upwards-spiral in the original Helix tower. Sector gave me the idea of a
sudden shift in structure and architecture when the player goes into a sector, and after activating
the switch, the tower and the helix emerges from the ground, with monsters teleporting all over the shop.

Some other Xaserish features are the big height differences, difficult monster encounters that encourages
responsible ammo usage for the most part, some abstract architectures, and some unorthodox lightings, such
as the Wicked Garden-like caves (that was a blatant rip-off by the way, apologies for that).

Mapping format is in Boom obviously because I hate worrying about visplanes and HOMs, more particularly so
when you're trying to imitate a freak mapper.

Overall, I am quite pleased with the result. It may not be 100% genuine Xaser (or as good as his maps in 
general), but I think it's a pretty cool map on its own. It was a good experience having to map
differently out of my comfort zone. It has taught me to manipulate different shaped sectors perhaps
more efficiently and creatively, and to be able to create non-symmetric layouts with more flexibility.
