Description: 6 map hub for Hexen based around the world of Chronos. Story
takes place 18 years after the events of Hexen in which the capitol city
of Chronos is suddenly invaded by evil forces and the 3 legendary heros
who defeated Korax must step up and restore peace to the now fallen city.

Its been quite a while that I last released a major Doom-related project.
Unfortuently, inspiration and motivation were the only bottlenecks in getting
this thing done. Towards the end, I was getting really lazy and began cutting
out rooms, puzzles and even a level in order to finish this hub once and
for all. Artifacts/mana balance was another huge problem as each player class
were horribly unbalanced from one another and had to either flag or strip out
lots of items to keep things somewhat challenging for each class.
