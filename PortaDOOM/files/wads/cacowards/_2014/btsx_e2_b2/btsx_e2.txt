Description             : Tower in the Fountain of Sparks is the second
                          episode of Back to Saturn X, a three-episode
                          partial conversion for Doom II.

                          Back to Saturn X is fully compatible with
                          Doom2.exe and Chocolate Doom. It has also been
                          tested with Eternity Engine, PrBoom-Plus,
                          ZDoom, GZDoom, and Risen3D.

                          IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT LOADING BTSX E2:

                          BTSX has been split into two wad files which must
                          be loaded together. This has been done in order
                          to work around an obscure vanilla crash involving
                          wads that exceed 4046 lumps.

                          Included in this zip archive are three files:

                            btsx_e2a.wad
                            btsx_e2b.wad
                            btsx_e2.deh

                          Vanilla or Chocolate Doom users should load
                          both wads alongside the btsx_e2.deh patch.

                          Source port users should only need to load the
                          two wad files together.

===========================================================================

                          This is still a beta release, so there may be
                          some minor issues encountered. Send in a report
                          if you run into anything really weird.
                          (Hopefully not.)

Additional Credits:

04 features additional mapping by Seele00TextOnly.

Thanks to Xaser for maintaining the compiled WAD, and providing the ZMAPINFO
and DEHACKED lumps.

Beyond the two levels he's directly credited for thing placements on,
dew's contributions extend to virtually every map. His detailed gameplay
recommendations are a big part of what's made BTSX what it is.

Bonus superthanks to Marcaek and Alfonzo for eagerly hopping on board to
bring fresh perspectives to the maps late in development, and for helping
out with skill setting refinement and the mad rush to the public release.

Similarly, thanks to j4rio and Ribbiks for playtesting MAP31!

Automap cleanup has been done primarily by Seele00TextOnly and Tarnsman.

Various OCD alignment fixes have been taken care of by Seele00TextOnly.

Episode end-screen map is by Tarnsman.

                          If you encounter visplane overflows or other buggy
                          behavior when playing Back to Saturn X, please send
                          us a report so we can look into the problem and fix
                          it!

May Not Run With...     : Back to Saturn X has not been tested with gameplay
                          mods, and we make no guarantees that it will work
                          as intended with one. The maps have been carefully
                          balanced for exciting gameplay with Doom's standard
                          monster and weapon behavior: if you're playing with
                          mods and run into issues, well... stop doing that.
