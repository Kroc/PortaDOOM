Description            : This is a Massmouth Christmas special, as it 
			 were.  I always wanted to make a Massmouth 
			 hub, and a few days ago I decided I would do 
			 it.  It's small and pretty linear, and it's 
			 not fast paced action or anything.  In fact 
			 it's more of a puzzle wad, so if you want some 
			 crazy run and gun, go play Alien Vendetta.
			 
			 The story takes place after the events of 
			 Massmouth 1, but before Massmouth 2, because 
			 making it follow the events of Massmouth 2 
			 would be a pain thanks to my genius idea of 
			 giving it six endings.  Everything will be 
			 explained in game, so enjoy!
			 
			 Also a nice thanks to various people who 
			 played the first version I released on DW 
			 and told me about any bugs and such.

* Play Information *

Game                    : zdoom.exe 2.0.94 or higher should work fine.
			  Anything lower that that use at your own risk.  
			  If don't know where to get zdoom, try here: 
			  http://zdoom.org/
			  You also need Massmouth 2, that is, massm2.wad 
			  which you can grab at the following link if 
			  you don't already have it (shame on you!):
			  http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/index.php?id=12090
			  
			  I can't stress this enough, YOU NEED MASSMOUTH 2 
			  IN ORDER TO PLAY THIS.  As for the command line: 
			  
			  zdoom.exe -file massm2.wad massmas.wad
			  
			  It's also important that they be in that order, 
			  I think it might break if they're out of order, 
			  but I'm not sure.

Editor(s) used          : WadAuthor, Paint Shop Pro 8, XWE, UltraEdit-32,

Build time              : Believe it or not, only 4 days

Known Bugs              : Misalignments in the cave areas because I'm lazy 
			  and they're only caves.  The rest should be okay, 
			  but I didn't go crazy.  There's also probably 
			  ways to break scripts if you try hard, but I'm 
			  pretty good at keeping scripts unbreakable, so 
			  you should be okay as long as you don't try to 
			  break them.
