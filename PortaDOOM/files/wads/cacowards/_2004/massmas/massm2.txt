Description            : The adventure continues, and stuff.  There isn't any 
			 backstory you need to know, thanks to cutscenes, but 
			 I suppose having played the first one may help out a 
			 bit.
			 
			 To play: zdoom.exe -file massm2.wad
			 
			 You can pretty much stop reading now if you want, 
			 but be warned the rest of the text file contains 
			 possible spoilers (mainly in the form of URLs).  
			 For extra stuff though, keep reading.

* Play Information *

Game                    : zdoom.exe with doom2.wad, you'll need the latest 
			  version of ZDoom 2.0 (find it at http://zdoom.org/)
			  
			  It works perfectly with the latest ZDoomgl as well, however, 
			  I don't recommend using it for this particular wad as the 
			  rendering of a couple areas gets screwed up slightly.
			  
Levels                  : 17 maps total
Single Player           : yes (intended)
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : not supported
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : nope
Difficulty Settings     : not really, though I haven't tested it on skill 5 
			  (or with -respawn) so play those settings at your 
			  own risk or something

New Sounds              : Yes

* Gameplay *

One of my main goals was to make this feel as unlike Doom as I could.  
Of course while there are still basic Doom elements, I think I've been 
fairly successful.  With that said, there are a couple fairly major 
changes to gameplay.  For one falling damage has been enabled, and I've 
slowed the player down to 75% speed (both of these hold true for all 
the maps except the secret one).  All part of my evil plot.

There is fairly extensive scripting and many cutscenes that will reveal 
more of the mass of words I like to call the story.  If you happen to 
miss something (for whatever reason) everything is logged in the console, 
so just press the ol' ~ key and catch up.

There are also a couple NPCs around.  Generally you don't want to kill 
them (usually things end bad for you if you do so anyway), and a lot of 
times you'll die too if they die, so be careful and stuff.  Standard NPC 
rules and all that.

On the subject of cheating, the maps are tested with god mode and it won't 
mess anything up, though sometimes god mode allows you to do things you can't 
do without it.  There are also a couple instances where you will die even if 
you have god mode on.  Just a heads up.  Also, if you absolutly must give yourself 
weapons, refrain from giving yourself keys (use IDFA, not IDKFA) because that 
will break things on a couple maps.

Kills don't matter.  Don't go crazy trying to get 100% kills.  In fact in some 
cases 100% kills is not even possible (and there's no intermission screens 
anyway).

Secret areas are not flagged.  There are seven secrets (more like easter eggs 
actually) and some out of the way areas, but you'll never get any secret credit.  
In the long run it doesn't even matter as none of the secret areas are necessary 
to complete the maps, though they will make life easier sometimes.

The final boss is HARD.  I'll probably get complaints, but he's supposed to be 
that tough.  Still, you don't have to fight him if you don't want...

* Construction *

Base                    : Maps  : Scratch
			  GFX   : Misc locations (with touchups here and there)
			  Sounds: Misc locations or scratch
			  Music : Misc authors

Editor(s) used          : WadAuthor, Warm, Paint Shop Pro 7, Wave Flow 4.5, 
			  SoundForge 6.0, Wintex, Deutex, Dehacked, DeepSea, 
			  WadCat, UltraEdit-32
			  
Build time              : Started it in May of 2000 and abandoned it around 
			  August of that same year.  I picked it up again 
			  sometime around November of 2002 and worked on it 
			  somewhat steadily since then.  So I guess around 
			  10 - 11 months of work.

Fixes			: From the original July 15th version:
			  - Fixed typo in one of the ending scripts
			  - Fixed typo in intermission screen before map13
			  - Altered the moving car sprites slightly (suggested 
			    by SargeBaldy)
			  From the second July 16th version:
			  - Left a couple people out of the credits
			  - Added three demos (zdoom 2.0.47 and higher should work)
			  From the July 18th version:
			  - Fixed bugs that surfaced recently thanks to bugfixes in 
			  ZDoom 2.0.60 with the final three maps.
			  - Made a couple textures warp (2.0.48 or higher required)
			  - Updated the demos to 2.0.60 (even though they didn't desync)
			  - Fixed the Linguica statue in MAP10
			  
Known Bugs              : The railgun doesn't switch out when it's out of ammo.  That 
			  wasn't intentional at first, but I liked the behavior, so I 
			  left it in.  So I guess it's not really a bug now...
			  
			  Monster patrol routes aren't perfect, so sometimes monsters 
			  will miss a door and appear to wander off their proper path.  
			  This won't effect scripts any (trust me, I playtested enough to 
			  account for it), but it looks weird sometimes, so, uh, ignore it 
			  I guess.
