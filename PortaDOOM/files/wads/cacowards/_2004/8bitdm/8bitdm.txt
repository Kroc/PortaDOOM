Description: This is a try to recreate Doom as it would be done in the 80's 
	     :P. 
	     My first DM package. So it's not as great as Exec.wad, 
 	     brit11.wad or dwango serie... Remember 80's? Oldschool graphics 
	     from old arcade games? Expect hyperactive graphics and music, fast 
	     Deathmatch and a very original concept. It's just weird. Try it!

* Construction *
Base         : Totaly from scratch.
Build Time   : 5 weeks. (about 3-4 hours a week on drawing). This is very 
		impressing to see how Doom Builder is a great editor. It saved 
		me a lot of time.
Editor(s) used : Doom Builder 1.03, Wintex 5.0, XWE, Paintshop pro 6 and XM player.
Known bug    : Some wall can hang movement... Don't know how to fix this... 
		don't worry it don't happen often. Blinking textures aren't 
		bugs.

May not run With... : doom2.exe :)

Modification after beta testing :
		- Fixed cramped gameplay from Map04 (Pacman)
		- Fixed visualy blocking "Welcome to 8 bit DM" on map01.
		- Fixed the time bricks remain down on map02. (Breakout)
		- Fixed some missing weapons, and missing jumping object on map05. Qbert's last Jump.
		- Fixed a lot of bug from the last map, map07, added items, remove camera object.
		- Fixed the bad placed teleport destination for the BFG9000.
		- Added 8bit style weapons by request from Skullers and Sonicice. ;-) It's better.
		- Slowed down the blinking frequency of PURPLE texture.
		- Fixed the random music system, now music change for every levels.
