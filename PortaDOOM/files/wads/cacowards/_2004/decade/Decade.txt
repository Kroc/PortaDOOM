Decade.....

11th December 2003 was Dooms 10th anniversary. I only found out about this in mid
November but decided I should make a map to celebrate the fact anyway. I'd had this
idea kicking around in my head for a MAP01 E1M1 hybrid for quite a while so I set
about building that. The 3 odd weeks I had to complete the map was going to be tight
but I though it managable. How wrong I was :)

I did pretty much finish the map within the alloted time period but it was, to put
it mildly, rubbish. So I abandoned that idea, salvaged what was good from it and
exapanded it from there. 6 months later this is the result. It's effectively a number
of re-interpretations of areas from Doom1 and Doom2 maps thrown together.

It's probably far too linear and a lot larger than I originally planned (it'll probably
take most people just under a hour to complete). This level throws ALOT of monsters at
you and at certain points in the map there is the potential for the player to stand in
the doorway and just shoot everything that comes out of the room. I realise that it's
not going to be to everyones tastes.

I designed this map to be played on UV skill setting. I have made slight modifications
for the lower skill levels. On HMP you'll get the shotgun almost immediately and a few
of the monsters have been removed (and I mean a FEW). On skills 1 and 2 you'll also
get the green armour immediately and slightly more healing and ammo at certain points
in the map (but not a great deal more). A few more monsters have been removed (or
changed) for levels 1 and 2.

Jumping is allowed. In fact you'll need to jump, but there is nothing too tricky.

There are loads of areas from Doom maps that I would loved to have included in this
map but I had to draw things to a close otherwise I'd have never finished this.

The title screen doom logo was taken from a doom desktop image that was in turn a
modification of the q3a install screen. Can't remember who did this modification.
If the author contacts me i'll adjust this text file to credit him (or her).

Finally, happy birthday to my son Matthew, who is 7 today :)
