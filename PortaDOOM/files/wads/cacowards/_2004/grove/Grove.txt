Description             : GROVE- THE STORY CONTINUES (...from where?)-
				In your garden, you can sometimes see an 
			  angry looking fat dude steal your mushrooms. He's 
			  Smugla. Whenever he takes them, he leaps into a deep 
			  hole in the floor like a rabbit. You've never 
			  catched him. One day you think "Gee- I wonder why 
			  he lives in the ground?" So one day, taking your 
			  pistol to blow that mushroom stealer to bits, you 
			  jump down the hole. "Lets see how he enjoys my 
			  mushrooms now!"... Whatever that means. You hit the
			  bottom of the hole, and you see the hole continue
			  horizontally down. So you go down it, and hit a 	
			  dead end. But then, you look up, and see another 
			  hole out "ha HA!" you retort. You climb out the 
			  hole, and look around- "Umm... where the hell am 
			  I?" You say, as you see the red skied, gold stared, 
			  tree covered, 7 frame per second frame rate world 
			  of Grove. You get out of the hole, and see Smugla's
			  house infront of you, with HIS mushroom garden, 
			  which are really your mushrooms that he stole. You 
			  might as well take them. They are yours- even if it 
			  would anger him. Where is he anyway?

				There is a map in his house, showing
			  his X on it. Hmm. I wonder why he wants to go 
			  there? Well, he IS a trans-galactical mushroom 
			  stealer - maybe its a huge mushroom grove? or maybe 
			  an opportunity to get other mushrooms from other 
			  dimensions? Who knows. Do you? You do don't you- 
			  don't lie. Tell me- TELL ME!! 

			  END OF STUPID STORY
		  
			  
			  P.S- Sorry about all those trees. Its a relatively
			  small level anyway. You just have to be observant 
			  at times and a good shooter. The ammo can be pretty
			  tight at times I guess. You'd probably just IDDQD, 
			  IDKFA it to the end won't you. Tsk tsk.

			 I did.

Known Bugs              : Oh god yes. Where do i begin- 
			  *I had a lot of bugs and crashes when making this
			  wad. I hope its still alright, I didn't fully play
			  it when I completed the thing, so there could still
			  be stuff-ups. I hope it actually plays at least.
			  * The room that 
			  'transforms' into a tech room should have its floor
			  change to that SHAWN type texture (flat32 I think).
			  though it doesn't work, and stays on the blue 
			  texture. In fact, none of the floor textures 
			  in that room change. The whole thing only seems to 
			  work in Edge. I've given up trying to fix it- doesn't
			  really matter anyway I guess *tear rolls down my 
			  eye as I wish it could work* Still it might work 
			  on some other version of the other doom engines, 
			  but not on the ones I have.
			  *Do not use Boom- It still works on it, sure, but
			  all the monsters in the level can hear when you 
			  cap off a single shot. This is bullshit and isn't
			  supposed to happen. At least, this happens on my 
			  version of Boom, there may be later versions that 
			  it might work correctly on.
			  *The textures of the back of the various sign posts
			   around the level are way off in some engines, like
			  Boom or Edge. In Zdoom it looks correct. Go use 
			  Zdoom.
			  *When I try to use Boom, I get like 149 column 
			  errors. What columns? Did I put columns in the 
		     	  level? So is that it- It won't work because I 
			  didn't put any columns in the level? What a 
			  picky interior-decorating engine. Na- but seriously,
			  its some dumb texture problem, that only happens in 
			  Boom from what I've tried. Use Zdoom.
			  *When you enter that house at the beginning of the
			  level, your hard drive might get terminally 
			  corrupted. I know, I know. It sounds bad. I've had 
			  three hard drives get corrupted and have never 
			  worked since. Theres about a one in three chance of 
			  it not corrupting though, so you have a chance. So
			  before entering it, utter a short prayer or have 
			  the good book near you. Remember 'The penetant man
			  may pass, the penetant man may pass...'
			  *Heres a weird one- when you're about to enter the 
			  forest part, your monitor may implode and create a 
			  sort of weak black hole, sucking in your pieces of 
			  papers and stuff from your table. This is due to 
			  linedef #2334, and I can't really fix it sorry.

P.S those last two Known Bugs are a lie. No seriously, I was just kidding.
You can put your prayer book down now. All the other Known Bugs are real 
though.
