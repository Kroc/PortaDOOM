Description            : Action Doom is meant to try and bring back the run and gun
                         feeling from the old 2D shooters like Contra and Metal Slug.
                         In the tradition of such games there are no bullet weapons,
                         only projectiles.  And just like Contra every enemy and
                         subsequently you, all have but one hit point, aside from
                         bosses and mini bosses.

                         To make the game feel more 2D and less frustrating, you will
                         never be attacked from behind, and the level is entirely
                         linnear.

Story (From the Manual): The year is 2174 and the Union Aerospace Corporation is in
			 over its head.  On a remote island in the Gulf of Mexico,
			 the United States Goverment funded the construction of the
			 top secret UAC Site 4 Labs.  They were to be in charge of
			 the work the government was unwilling to show the public.
			 Originally, the base was constructed to investigate extra
			 terrestrial lifeforms buried deep beneath the surface of
			 the earth.  Recently however, scientists and army officials
			 together have begun teleportation experiments... into other
			 dimentions.  Using this newfound portal technology, the
			 United States Government has created a gateway into Hell
			 itself.

			 As if things couldn't get more convoluted, the story doesn't
			 end there.  Now, never content to just sit idle, scientists
			 at UAC Site 4 have begun genetically altering demons brought
			 back from hell, with the DNA from the Aliens found at the
			 crash site.

			 It has been a week since any contact has been made with
			 Site 4, and the government has only one option left, the men
			 and women of the most elite government task force known as
			 I.M.P.S.E.  It's up to you to discover what happened to the
			 UAC Installation.

Base                    : Maps  : From Scratch
			  GFX   : Entirely Original, aside from the few graphics and
                                  textures mentioned above.
			  Sounds: Misc locations or scratch
			  Music : Julian, Misc authors

Editor(s) used          : Wintex, Doom Builder, Paint Shop Pro 6, Soundforge 4.5,
                          Photoshop 7, WadAuthor, XWE
			  
Build time              : Started Around September 2003, but the original "subject" had
			  been started years ago.  It was a simple patch that had
			  you fire projectiles from the doom pistol while everything
			  died in one hit.

Fixes			: None
			  
Known Bugs              : Due to extensive Dehacked work, I have encountered...

			  When you pick up the clipboards, you can never select them
			  again.  In order to avoid doom autoselecting them in battle
			  I gave them 0 ammo, so it only allows you to pick them up
			  but never select back to them.

			  Occasionally, the shots fired by the endboss will hit and not
			  dissappear.  This shouldn't interfere with gameplay at all.

			  Any other problems are probably your fault for using God mode.
