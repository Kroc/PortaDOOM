Description             : Tremor is a medium-sized techbase map, fairly open-plan but cramped in some areas.  This is my first proper released map but I think I've definetly come a long way.

Additional Credits to   : CodeImp for his fantastic editor Doombuilder, Boris for editing tips and testing, Scuba, Dron, Tom_D, CapNapalm, _Hyena_ & Manc for testing, DiluteCo for the awesome midi, dn for being a total ACTION hero and SoM for being sexy (and testing)
