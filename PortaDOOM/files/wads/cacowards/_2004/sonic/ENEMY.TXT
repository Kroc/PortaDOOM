==============================================================================

There are lots of enemies in Super Sonic DooM, here's an overview of them:


================================Basic Enemies=================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Former Human (Score: 50)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Used to be human, now a zombie with a pop-gun.  Only a risk at low health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Former Sergeant (Score: 100)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Also a zombie, but carrying a shotgun and quite a punch.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Former Commando (Score: 150)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another zombie, but with a chaingun that's guaranteed to annoy at all ranges.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Imp (Score: 200)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most basic of born monsters, these throw fireballs and scratch at you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Lost Soul (Score: 250)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A flaming skull that acts as a full-body weapon, these will easily show up in 
any light, but can attack underwater.  They favour dark and cramped places.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Demon (Score: 300)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fast-moving pink thing that'll rip your head off if you get too close to it.
Only they're now faster than ever before, so they're no pushover now.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Cacodemon (Score: 400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The killer tomato.  Flies around and attacks underwater, too.  Doesn't like 
pain though, and is fairly easy to hit, so it's not too bad.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Hell Knight (Score: 500)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A tough bruiser with a tough fireball and pain resistance, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Pain Elemental (Score: 600)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not only do they fly and swim, they also throw lost souls at you!  At least 
they have no close-range attack and they don't like pain themselves, making 
them easy to take down.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Revenant (Score: 700)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A fast but fragile skeletal being, armed with a punch and homing missiles! 
Guaranteed to have you dancing at high speeds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Arachnotron (Score: 800)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A noisy mechanical spider with a plasma gun.  Dangerous if they get going, but
also have a low pain tolerance and while their weapon is nasty, they take time
to aim it, and the plasma stream can easily be walked into other monsters...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Mancubus (Score: 900)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A big fat ugly thing, packing some heavy firepower.  He's slow and easy to 
hit, but is quite strong too, and one blast from his weapon could be too much.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Archvile (Score: 1100)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A truly dangerous foe.  Faster than most, tougher than most, can blow you away
with just one spell and on top of that can resurrect other monsters!  He is 
vulnerable when casting his spells though, and he can only resurrect certain 
types of monster.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Mini Cyberdemon (Score: 1500)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, the cyberdemon now has offspring.  These are a bit smaller, have bright 
yellow circuitry and sport a rapid-fire plasma gun.  It's not all bad though, 
as they're only half as strong as their father figures.


==============================Enhanced Enemies================================


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Enhanced Imp (Score: 350)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are faster, stronger and slightly larger than ordinary imps, but still 
attack with their claws and fireballs, although the fireball is more harmful.
They come in a variety of colours, depending on the zone you're in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Suicidal Soul (Score: 450)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sporting a fiery green haircut, these skulls move faster, take more to stop 
and they have a tendency to explode when close enough to you!
Like their fiery red cousins, they favour dark, cramped environments and can 
also attack underwater.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Enhanced Demon (Score: 650)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are larger, faster and stronger than ordinary demons, and consequently 
they'll annoy you more, especially in close quarters!
They come in a variety of colours, depending on the zone you're in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Rail Elemental (Score: 850)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't be transfixed by their bright blue eye, as when that mouth opens you'll 
have to be quick to avoid a devastating railgun attack!  They're slightly 
quicker than the pain elementals, but they can still attack underwater.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Baron of Hell (Score: 1000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are a lot like Hell Knights, only they're pink-chested, are twice as 
tough, and have now evolved so they throw out multiple fireballs!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Enhanced Cacodemon (Score: 1200)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are larger, faster and stronger than ordinary cacos, and throw out 3 
fireballs instead of one.  Like their red counterparts, they also have the 
ability to attack underwater, so beware!
They come in a variety of colours, depending on the zone you're in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Revenant Terminator (Score: 1400)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A dangerous opponent, these wear fetching orange trousers and have upgraded to
full-sized rockets!  But despite being tougher and larger than the original 
red version, they do have a tendency to hurt themselves as well as you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Shadow Archvile (Score: 2000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One of the worst of an even badder lot! He's partially invisible, is twice as 
hard to take down and is quicker at casting his spell!  Fortunately these are 
quite rare, but when you meet one you'll really have to be on your toes!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Giant Mancubus (Score: 3000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just when you thought he couldn't get any fatter, he doubles in size!  He's 
also turned blood-red in colour, pumps out more fireballs quicker and takes 
an awful lot more hits to puncture him. He tends to shrug off explosions, too.
But he's still quite slow, so take advantage of this when battling him.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Spider Mastermind (Score: 4000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A giant mechanical spider with a super-chaingun.  However they've now been 
programmed to resist pain a lot better, so they're a lot tougher than before.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
			    Cyberdemon (Score: 5000)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A rocket-launching skyscraper with goat legs and plenty of danger. 'Nuff said.


===============================Mercenary Enemies==============================


These ex-marines have been hired as mercenaries to help security at various 
places.  They come in 11 different flavours, each one with a different colour 
and wielding a different weapon, which they will drop when you kill them. 
Speeds, strengths and scores vary with mercenary.  A table is below:

		Fist 		  - White/Grey  	(Score: 100)
		Berserk 	  - Purple/Blue 	(Score: 350)
		Chainsaw 	  - Tan/Brown    	(Score: 200)
		Pistol 	  	  - Grey/Dark Brown     (Score: 300)
		Shotgun 	  - Orange/Dark Orange  (Score: 400)
		Chaingun 	  - Yellow/Tan 		(Score: 500)
		Super shotgun     - Red/Dark Red    	(Score: 600)
		Rocket launcher   - Brown/Tan  		(Score: 700)
		Plasma gun 	  - Blue/Indigo   	(Score: 800)
		Railgun 	  - Indigo/Black 	(Score: 900)
		BFG 		  - Green/Natural Green (Score: 1000)

(Colours are listed as body armour/boots+shoulder pads, no helmets are worn)

There are also NPC's (non player characters) that you will come up against, 
and they will be somewhat tougher to beat than the mercenaries - notably 
they wield multiple weapons and their armour flashes different colours.


==============================Stealth Enemies=================================


One of the newest inventions of FAC is the stealth pack, a state-of-the-art 
security system that renders the wearer totally invisible!  Fortunately, an 
attack by the wearer will disrupt the effect for a short time, and the packs 
are issued only in the most important and heavily guarded locations.
Only basic enemies can wear stealth packs, a score table is below:

Stealth former human - 100
Stealth former sergeant - 200
Stealth former commando - 300
Stealth imp - 350
Stealth lost soul - 450
Stealth demon - 550
Stealth cacodemon - 650
Stealth hell knight - 850
Stealth pain elemental - 950
Stealth revenant - 1150
Stealth arachnotron - 1250
Stealth mancubus - 1350
Stealth archvile - 1550
Stealth mini cyberdemon - 1950


==============================Boss Enemies===================================


There are also a few boss enemies present - these will flash various colours 
and wield a deadly attack!  They're also extremely tough to knock down but 
the reward will be worth it.
