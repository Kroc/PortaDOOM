1. Introduction
----------------

After countless hours of hard work, the first hub of RTC-3057 is complete. We are very pleased with how it has turned out, and hope you will be too. The hub consists of 7 levels and takes place on the Federal Commonwealth of Earth's flagship, "The Enforcer". It is a mod for Doom2 using the powerful port of Zdoom. You probably already know this, so...Enjoy!

The believable and highly detailed environment together with quality sounds makes this wad incredibly immersive. And for once, it's a wad where you actually fear the individual monster rather than the masses of monsters - just like in the first Doom game.

Get your pistol, ready your gear and prepare to enter the depths of the haunted hallways.

	-dsm

The combination of awesome level design, impressive scripting, and brilliant music make RTC-3057 Hub 1 the most incredibly atmospheric wad I've ever played. It's very well put together and Keeps you on your toes the whole way through. If Doom 3 is this good, I'll be happy.

	-AirRaid

This is Doom like never before.  Be prepared for an immersive world of thought and action with a little suspense around every corner.

	-Manc

RTC-3057 is a truly unique experience. It takes Doom to a higher level and it will blow you away.
