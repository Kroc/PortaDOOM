Description :

Pretty cool level, not my favorite out of the level set, but a helluva way to start off!!
This demo is okay, but I'm sure there is going to be some serious improvements when this 
level set hits the public... :)

Some note worthy parts of the map would be the following...

1) The Hell Temple fight near the end of the level!! This part has always given me problems
   I don't know exactly what it is, but I always manage to die in this fight. You have the
   chance to use three invulns, and somehow I still manage to eat dirt!!! Hehe, as a very 
   intelligent person once said to me "I think the reason you die so much in that area, is
   because of your over attachment to a certain weapon"... In other words, WATCH THOSE 
   ROCKETS!!!

2) The cyberdemon maze at the levels end.... Hmmm, what can I say about this part of the
   map? You WILL have to ssg the remaining cyberdemons, and that in itself can be a helluva
   chore!!! It's pretty dark in that part of the map, so expect to eat at least one rocket!
   My battle in the demo, didn't go too well... You'll see what I mean when you watch it!

So, now its onto map02 and then the dreaded map03!!!

Enjoy,

Huy: It's a suprisingly strong demo, you really should consider the fact that Ragnew was
     Keyboarding the whole time (Holy fuck!!!), showing us that map01 is by no means
     overwhelming... Go ahead and blow ammo away as you wish, use the cells and rockets 
     liberally, but it all boils down to oldskool arcade-style slugfests, so dodge well.
