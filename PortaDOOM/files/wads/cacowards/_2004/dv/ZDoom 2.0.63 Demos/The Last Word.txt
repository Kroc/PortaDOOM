Well, what to say? First off, I'd like to say thanks to Huy aka Converted Doomer for the
opportunity to help him beta test this MONSTER for the last 7 - 8 months (or maybe it was 9).
I think he's made a helluva level/level set here, and I hope that everyone enjoys playing the
maps as much as I enjoyed giving him insight on some of these levels... I honestly think that
Huy has managed to come up with a one of a kind mapset here, and its definitely up there with
my favorites... GREAT JOB HUY!!!

Some of the maps may seem, well, somewhat impossible at first, but be sure to watch the demos
that were recorded for all of these levels... Each is a UV 100/100 run... Maybe not as fast
as possible, but it does show that the levels are competable from a pistol start...

Another BiG THANKs would have to go out to Drew "STX-Vile" Devore, for throwing in a killer 
map03, and map04 demo... So, you know it'll be good if Vile did it. Hopefully we'll see some more DV 
demos from Vile in the future...

But thats about it and I hope you guys enjoy the maps....
