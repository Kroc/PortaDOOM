Description             : A pack of 11 Deathmatch maps of varying themes. They're pretty much maps that I've accumulated over the past year, so the quality isn't as consistant as I'd like it to be; but I suppose it doesn't really matter. I just hope you guys can have fun with it.
Additional Credits      : Monolith, 3DRealms, Lobotomy Software, id, and Western Quake 3 for being awesome and for inspiration.  Crista Forest, Chris Buecheler, David Gevert, and Nick Baker for their various texture packs. "Gen", Hunt "Sage" Bridges, Connor Pelkey (Cyril), Insane Apu, SpinalBlood/Davide, CheapAlert(Leileilol), Gecko Yamori, Mark Jansen, Tsu Ryu, and Stockman of vgmusic.com for their various MIDIs that I used. Tom_D, Chaindude, Meatwad, Glortho, Manc, Deathz0r, and Nautilus for beta testing and/or giving advice. Nestea for linking me to the cool new logo, Aabra for helping me with the crazy cactus spawning script on map11, and Lazureus for the bridge trap script on map12. Finally, Mr. Carnevil(Carnbarn hehehe~!11) himself for Skulltag.
