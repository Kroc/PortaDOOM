Okay this is for folks who dont know the controls or how to play NAZI AUFESTEHUNG.

the goal of NAZI AUFESTEHUNG is to get to the exit and kill any Nazis or creatures. There will be obsltacles such as door that need certain keys.
thats when you have to find the key.
press "Tab" to look at the map, if you need help finding your way.
There is a cheat code which allows you to look at
EVERYTHING on the map.

There are 30 levels in NAZI AUFERSTEHUNG
and 2 secret levels 
(heres a hint, on level 15 look for a heavily guarded cooridor to
find the entrance for level 31, the first secret level)
(To find Level 32, look on level 31 and find a portal of fire, near you when
you start and press the action key to enter it, the action key is the "Spacebar" button,
but you can change that in the options menu)

so theres the level basics

BOSSES
there arent really any bosses 
but you do fight Rommel, Hitler's top general
every now and then
and he is brought back from the dead every now and then
and you fight Hitler himself
along with Rommel on level 29
you must fight Satan in level 30, good luck with that!
The only way to kill satan is to fire missiles into his brain

ENEMIES
you will face different kinds of enemies in NAZI AUFERSTEHUNG
which you must kill
note that they can all be killed the same way: using your weapons
BUT when fighting Satan on the last level
you MUST fire Missiles into his brain
and forehead area
so use your Missiles carefully when fighting him in level 30
I suggest using only using Missiles since it is the only effective thing against Satan
and ONLY USE THE BFG
when facing a lot of enemies and/or facing Rommel or Hitler/clones
Use the Missiles for them as well
but make sure to save some Missiles to Defeat SATAN
