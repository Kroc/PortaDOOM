Description             : Vae Victus II is an all new level set for Doom 2
                          utilizing new graphics and music. The episode
                          consists of 7 levels of varying themes and
                          difficulty. The first Vae Victus was an attempt
                          to honor the traditional gameplay of Alien
                          Vendetta and other classic megawads; however,
                          VV2 is a more balanced approach that provides
                          challenging battles without the swarms of
                          roaming enemies.  The architecture is improved
                          over last year's offering, and is more refined
                          in it's concept and design. I am a classic
                          doomer at heart, so I decided to keep this wad
                          compatible with every source port that allows
                          for limit removing. Co-op play is also
                          supported, as are difficulty settings. In
                          addition, every map can be beat from pistol
                          starts.
                          
                          If you enjoyed Vae Victus, I have no doubt that
                          you'll enjoy Vae Victus II.
