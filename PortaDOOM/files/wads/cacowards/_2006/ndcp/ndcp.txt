Release notes           : This project started on November 11th, 2002 when Xtife (Sparky) posted 
                          on the Newdoom forums about the idea of us putting together a megawad. The idea took
                          off quickly and between the time this started and the release date, many mappers came 
                          and went. A lot of map slots changed hands. Somewhere during development, Team leader 
                          Sparky decided to pass the Leadership role on to myself (Doom_Dude) and since I was 
                          already doing as much as possible, including maintaining the website, I decided to 
                          take the lead. Anyhow a lot of hard working Doom Community members helped in getting 
                          this done. Without the dedicated level designers this project wouldn't have made it to 
                          finish. Thanks to everyone who contributed and helped out. I'm so glad it's done. :)
			  
Gameplay Notes          : As of the time of release the doom port Doomsday has issues with maps 06 and 27
                          which causes the port to crash. It is recommended you play using ZDoom, ZDoomGL,
                          Prboom, GZDoom, Risen 3D and Legacy.

                          This megawad does not contain secret levels so don't go looking for hidden switches 
                          in maps 15 and 31. When you play through the exit switches will take you from map 15 to 31 
                          then 32 and back to 16 without you having to search for secrets to get to these maps...
                          
                          It's up to you, the player as to how you play this megawad. Either play each map from a 
                          'pistol start'or play it through without restarting each level..
                          
                          This is a single player megawad with coop starts included. We didn't have time to
                          playtest the Coop gameplay so play with that in mind.

Authors comments    : First map I made when I came back to the Doom community last year. Anyway, it's pretty much 
                      completely nonlinear, so if that's not your style, then you won't like this map.

Build time          : No idea. >_>
Editor(s) used      : WadEd, XWE, WinDEU, WinTEX
Author's comments   : It's a classical techmap, with some new textures to liven things up. It doesn't make
                      any more sense than any usual Doom map, but it has a semi-realistic feel to it.

Editor(s) used      : WinDEU 5.24, Zennode
Authors comments    : A bit more focused on gameplay instead of architecture, but still... FYI: the word 'campus' 
                      does not imply that this wad is based around any existing architecture or persons. They're 
                      just randomly thought up and connected hallways.

Authors comments    : Ahem... due to bad circumstances BlackFyre was unable to finish his level and the one he was 
                      working on got nuked. So he aske me (Doom_Dude) if I would finish the map. I only had 1½ days
                      to try and finish what was an older copy of his map. At the point that you enter a round outside 
                      area with Cacodemons you have entered my area and left BlackFyre's. Like I said I had 1½ days...
                      I think Doom Builder is on Fyre. heh...

Authors comments    : I (this is me again: Doom_Dude) started this map as an idea for a possible replacement map if we needed 
                      a level to fill any holes near the completion of the NDCP. It just happens that we did need it afterall.
                      Thankfully those who helped make the level did a spiffy job to make things interesting. If your really
                      interested in who did what parts, check out the screenie on the NDCP site (link at top of readme).
