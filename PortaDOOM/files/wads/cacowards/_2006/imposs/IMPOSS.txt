The Story So Far	: Turns out you were brainwahsed by your boss, 
			  Mr. Oxford. That cocksucker. Normally, you're used to
			  lounging in your hotel room at 2 a.m. abusing Vicodin 
			  and jerking off while watching C-SPAN. But Mr. Oxford 
			  had other things in mind. You see, Mr. Oxford's parents
			  both molested him when he was little. So naturally, 
			  perversion was in his blood. That's why he's been 
			  calling you in during the wee hours to file papers that
			  he threw on the floor. It was so he could go by your 
			  house and bang your wife, who's blind and couldn't 
			  figure out it wasn't you. 
			  Tonight on the other hand, he calls you in to scrub 
			  stains off his office floor with shampoo and a toothbrush.
			  But in his haste to stick it to your little lady, he 
			  forgot to fill you in on your daily brainwashing routine--
			  a series of "corporate training videos". So naturally, you
			  follow him out as he leaves, and you track him to your 
			  house. You've been wondering why it smelled like your boss
			  every time you went down on your wife. Now you know. 
			  Time for some payback. 
			  You've delivered packages to Mr. Oxford's house before, so
			  it takes you no time at all to drive recklessly over there.
			  Mrs. Oxford answers the door (after you've kicked it open)
			  brandishing a wimpy looking pistol. You tell her you're 
			  delivering a special package for her husband. But she 
			  decides she wants your package all to herself. She drops 
			  the gun and is all over you, like pastrami on rye. 
			  The two of you get drunk on cranberry schnapps and fornicate
			  like a couple of rabid hyenas. You decide you won't need to
			  pistol fuck her after all. 
			  It's about that time Mr. Oxford shows up. You tell him he 
			  must have forgotten something, and you let him have it right
			  between the eyes with his wife's gun. God, that gun even 
			  sounds wimpy. Like a kid popping a paper bag. Now 
			  Mrs. Oxford is so smashed right now she has no idea what's
			  going on. Which suits you just fine. After finishing your
			  session with her, you look around for a shovel and a big 
			  bucket of lye. All you can muster up is the shovel and a 
			  fifty round clip for your gun. 
			  You drag your boss next door to the local Indian burial 
			  ground (conveniently situated by a radioactive waste 
			  compound) and dig up a grave while drinking your schnapps. 
			  A wilted Indian woman corpse awaits Mr. Oxford's company. 
			  Now maybe it's the schnapps talking, but that's a cute little
			  Indian woman. You know, for a corpse, she's fucking hot. 
			  So you have your way with her/it for a while until the stench
			  of body rot gets to you. You carefully position your boss 
			  next to her. And after unloading your gun into his spine, 
			  you manage to fit his head up his own ass. You piss on them 
			  both and bid your adieu. For good measure, you dig up the 
			  chief in the adjacent grave and piss on him too. 
			  A job well done. Until you realize that weird echoing tribal
			  chanting noise is coming from the other graves. Must be some
			  radioactive Indian zombies. 
			  You rush drunkenly back into the house and dress into your 
			  boss's green Hazmat suit. You shove in the fifty round clip
			  and put on a pair of tan gloves. You stick some brass knuckles
			  in your pocket just in case. These feather-wearing bastards 
			  are going to get schooled. Well, maybe if there weren't 
			  seventy of them waiting for you outside the door. Before you
			  can get a shot off, they grab you with their gnarled, bony 
			  hands and hoist you over to a black, bottomless pit. 
			  Sure, they could have given you fair warning and let you go. 
			  But boy, once they threw you in, you thought you'd be falling
			  forever. But we won't know because your pansy ass blacked out
			  somewhere along the way. 
			  When you wake up (with a bad hangover), you find yourself in 
			  an otherworldly place. Like something out of that Hexen game
			  or something. Only weirder. The putrid aroma of rotting meat
			  fills the air. This place just smells evil. You stand up in 
			  your heavy Hazmat suit, and you hold out your wimpy pistol 
			  like you're aiming at something but there isn't anything 
			  there. You hear bells and then some sort of music plays. 
			  You can't figure out where it's coming from, but it just 
			  loops over and over again. Now what?

Description		: Don't trust your instincts.
			  Don't trust your sense of reality.
			  This fall, there are more than three dimensions.
