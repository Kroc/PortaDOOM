**SPECIAL NOTES**

This wad now works in both the latest Official release of
ZDoom (2.1.x editions) as well as GZDoom.

However, there seem to be some very slight issues regarding GZdoom... The
fusion cannon's alt-fire doesn't want to work right and the Dynamic Lighting
support is very incomplete. I would recommend standard ZDoom, although I've
made sure that it doesn't crash insanely in GZDoom as well... or at least,
I hope it doesn't! :P


Because of the complex nature of this wad, some people tend to get stuck
in places in some of the maps, so I've included a FAQ in a seperate
texfile: zendyn_f.txt. If for some reason you get stuck, check there BEFORE
you ask me something. If you're absolutely sure that your problem isn't
mentioned anywhere in the FAQ, don't hesitate to e-mail me about it. :P

Finally, in order to view the intro correctly, you need a resolution of
800x600 or higher. Sorry for the inconvienience or anything. :P


Okay, now onward with the standard textfile formation thing or whatever.

Description             : One seemingly random day, I was sitting around doing
                          nothing... when it hit me: The perfect way to make
                          true reloading weapons in Zdoom. It worked like a
                          charm in an example wad I put together, but I thought
                          that a simple demo wad with a single test level would
                          not do the reloading trick any justice... so two weeks
                          later, I brought you this:
                          Zen Dynamics, a Zdoom Revolution.

                          Zen is a 7-level partial conversion, with 10 new guns,
                          complete with reloading, new baddies, music, textures,
                          you name it. It has some pretty damn memorable
                          moments, particularly in Map04 and Map07, and is not
                          just some quickly thrown together wad.

                          This wad was originally released on the ZDoom forums,
                          as a "public beta" of sorts, before releasing to the
                          /idgames archive for all you crazy people to enjoy. :P

                          The initial release only took two weeks to finish, but
                          as always, it was littered with random bugs and such.
                          I released several revisions that fixed said bugs,
                          but I got bored at just fixing minor stuff... so for
                          the fabled 2.0 release, I added several things: a new
                          level, a new weapon, and some story elements and such.

                          And now, I present you with the Anniversary Edition,
                          packed with tons and tons of new features -- Altfires,
                          Two more new weapons, and a brand-new map, Core Zero,
                          perfect for mass-destruction addicts! :P

                          Yes, there's a small storyline involved, with the
                          usual stuff like gateways and UAC and such, but the
                          intro does a pretty good job at telling it, IMO. :P

                          The highlight of the wad is probably the weapons,
                          which are pretty much a first in Zdoom history. Just
                          the combination of advanced weaponry with Zdoom
                          features like ACS and portals (which I know you'll
                          love so much more after you've played Map04).

                          Either way, it's been way too long since I've released
                          anything memorable, and I guarantee you will not
                          forget this wad. :P Sorry for all the bragging and 
                          such, but hey.... it's true. :P

                          Maps:

                          Malcolm Sailor - Mega-huge thanks for msscraps.zip
                          (in the prefabs directory at /idgames). Most of the
                          levels are based on something-or-other from that set.
                          Thanks, man! :P

                          B. Vanatta - Whatever the B. stands for, does it even
                                       matter? Anyway, the base for Map02 was
                                       obtained from his Danzig15.wad deathmatch
                                       map. Muchas gracias y cosas!

                          Zero Prophet - A bit of 'ghostwriting' in a couple
                                         areas -- he created a the
                                         'background' scenes in two maps:
                                         Map08's city skyline and Map03's
                                         outdoor fight-scene. Kick ass. :P

                          Weapons:

                          NMN - Kickass weapon artist. He's responsible for
                                creating the Assault Rifle.
                          Corrupt Marine - the Dual Plasma SMGs and the
                                           fusion cannon are his work. Keep up
                                           the insanely awesome work!
                          Scero - He drew the graphics for the Scorcher weapon.
                                  Nice work!
                          Shinjanji - He did the hand for the Bloodsphere
                                       weapon, which fits perfectly. Good job!
                          Xenophon - Created the awesome bullet casing code, 
                                     used in the game's bullet weapons.
                                     I still can't thank you enough for that!
                          Caligari_78 - Creation of the new and improved
                                        bullet puffs. Your name shall live on
                                        forever or some such! :P


                          Monsters:

                          LilWhiteMouse - The genius behind the Hell's Battery,
                                          which is possibly the most awesome
                                          enemy ever created! She was also the
                                          first one to create the boss health
                                          bar script, although I scripted my
                                          version myself. Anyway, big huge
                                          thanks to her!

                          Misc. Graphics:

                          Apothem - Created the menu graphics and such, which
                                    kick total ass and such!
                          MasterOFDeath - Put together the DOOMDEFS lighting
                                          definitions for use with GZDOOM...
                                          I can't believe I forgot about this
                                          for 2.5's release. ;P


                          Bug testers:

                          Belial - Found LOADS of bugs everywhere, ranging from
                                   weapons to maps, and everything in between.
                                   Thanks a hell of alot and stuff!
                          Zero Prophet - He's probably played the wad more than
                                         anyone else... myself included. Nearly
                                         everything in the wad has been
                                         bugtested hundreds of times, so muchas
                                         gracias, mi amigo!
                          Pika135 - Discovered a strange bug where you could
                                         jump through the windows to Map04's
                                    supercharge room, therefore getting stuck.

Extras			: Eh? What extras? Well, there are two very special files
                          included in the release, in addition to zendyn_x.wad:

                          zendyn_f.txt : The official Zen Dynamics FAQ... that's the same
                                          one I used to tack on to the bottom of this
                                          textfile in all the beta releases. I seperated
                                          it "for both clarity and confusion" (Zero-ism).
                          zenblack.wad : In case the standard Doomguy hands don't quite
                                          tickle your fancy, this add-on is for you.
                                          Load over the main Zen wadfile and it will add
                                          black gloves to all the weapons instead of those
                                          ugly fleshtone things he's always seen wearing.
                                           :P


* Construction *

Base                    : Most are based off levels found in msscraps.zip, found
                          in the /idgames/prefabs directory. Bigass thanks to
                          Malcom Sailor for the maps and stuff. :P Map02 is
                          based on danzig15.wad, so thanks to B. Vanatta for
                          making that map. :P (Don't worry, both of the 
                          textfiles to these wads allowed modified levels and
                          stuff, so try not to complain or anything. :P)
Build Time              : As of version 2.5, exactly ONE YEAR. Happy anniversary!
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder, XWE, Sound Recorder, Paint Shop Pro,
                          Windows Paint, Notepad, Impulse Tracker,
                          and so on and so forth. :P

Known Bugs              : There is a minor HOM on the outdoor part of Map04, but
                          that's due to the dodgy rendering of the portals and
                          such. Blame Doom's quirky rendering engine. :P
                          Hopefully, you won't even notice it's there. :P

                          Also, the interior room of Map04's cathedral tends to
                          slow down the game a hell of alot, so I hope you have
                          a fast computer. :P

                          Running the wad with GZDoom fixes both of these
                          problems, but not the following one...

                          Due to Map08's complexity, many of the outdoor areas
                          have the infamous 'sky clipping' effect (ie, a portion
                          of sky obscures other structures when it's blocking
                          your view... you'll understand what I mean).
                          Unfortunately, this is impossible to fix without
                          spending days splicing the level and rebuilding
                          EVERYTHING using portal effects, which would be time
                          consuming and slow down the wad like hell on a stick.
                          Sorry for the inconvenience... just blame Zero. :P
