Description             : You're a Space marine...

                          Disease. An incurable though tangible threat. The
                          demons prowl among the scorched barrens of Mars.
                          Fleets of cacodemons infest every region.
                          Spectres and imps swarming from every crevice.
                          Deep down under Mars' subterra lies UAC's immense
                          labyrinth of superhuman technology. The
                          underground top secret lair of their most
                          horrific experiments, buried in distress.

                          This is UAC Ultra.

                          An 11 (and a half) map levelset for Doom 2
                          featuring all new textures, a new monster, new
                          music and several other small touches. Difficulty
                          will hopefully keep you on your feet without
                          being ridiculous.

                          The texture set is available as ultratex.wad

                          v1.2 fixes bugs on all maps. Plus it works with
                          Eternity. Thanks esselfortium and Doomworld!
