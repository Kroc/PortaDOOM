[1] INTRODUCTION
----------------

  Speed of Doom is a 32 level megawad (made by two of us) that provides
  fast paced kills and thrills. The project was originally meant to be
  a 'semi-speedmapping' project, where we were limited to one week per
  map and focus mostly on smallish maps but as time went on, the maps
  consumed more time to create, and started to be more complex and
  started varying in sizes. In the end it took about one year to
  complete which isn't half bad. Overall, most maps are smallish and/or
  quick with mostly short and sweet gameplay, hence the title Speed of
  Doom. However there are some maps that are pretty big and sometimes
  can take a lot more time to finish. The time to finish a map varies
  from 0-10 minutes most of the time, wheras some can take as long as
  10-20 minutes (very few though). Difficulty is not suited for the faint
  of hearts. While the megawad is divided into 3 episodes (easy/medium,
  medium/hard,hard), it is designed to be challenging in different ways,
  mostly following traits of classic megawads like Plutonia Experiment1/2,
  Hell Revealed1/2, Alien Vendetta, Kama Sutra and Scythe1/2. On Ultra-
  violent (skill 4) settings, most of the maps play like Scythe 2 on
  skill 4 with the exception of several maps (mainly the later maps)
  playing like Alien Vendetta on skill 4. Skill2/3 is recommended for
  most doomers. All levels are completable from pistol start. There are
  many varieties of themes as we wanted the megawad to have good diversity.
  We hope most of you will enjoy playing the megawad (and hopefully you
  speedrunners/demoers can at least record a demo or two for this ;-) 


[1.1 Compatibility]

  Speed of Doom is designed to be BOOM Compatible so it should run
  on BOOM source ports derivatives at least. It will crash on several maps
  if you try to run with BOOM or MBF. Glboom or Prboom-plus is recommended.

[1.2 Resources]
 
   - Textures were taken from:
      + Plutonia Experiment
      + 5th Episode
      + Darkbase
      + Ultimate Doom
      + Gothic Textures
      + Claustrophobia 1024
      + NDCP2
      + Scythe 2
      + The rest custom made by Darkwave and Joshy

   - New graphics were made by:

      + Brett 'Mechadon' Harrell : Fonts, Status bar, Titlepic
                                   Intermission pic, Credits, Bossback

        Editors used: GIMP, Photoshop, XWE, SLumpEd, and Imagetool

[1.3 Midi Music]

   The new music for Speed of Doom was composed by:

   Stuart Rynn:
	Map01,03,08,09,15,16,21,24,25,26,27,31,32,33 Intro, Intermission and Story.

   James Paddock:
	Map05,07,23,29,30

   ** You may use these Midi tracks provided that you give credit to the
   composer and the project 'Speed of Doom'. **

   All other music are from other sources such as Heretic, Doom, and vgmusic
  (Check map info for more details)

[2] STORY
---------

  You wake up with a sore head inside a cave that you and other marines were checking out
  after hearing suspicious noises. You look up to the sky and realise it is all green as 
  a result of a foreign bomb that exploded. The aftereffects has consumed the whole planet.
  Fortunately, you are immune to the chemicals, but not so much for the others. Upon
  exploration of the infected bases, you confront very familiar enemies that have seemed to
  spawn or mutate all over the place. Apparently, Hell is back and just wants more and
  wasted no time initiating more chemical attacks on other bases. Eventually Earth will be
  hit and it is up to you, the lone marine to slow down and stop the ever-increasing speed
  of Doom that Hell will unleash.
  
  It is up to you to determine the speed of your doom before the inevitability of time...


----------------
[3] INSTALLATION
----------------

  Simply either drag drop sod.wad onto a source port executable (i.e. Zdoom or Prboom).
  Alternatively you can type into the command line:

  " boom -iwad doom2.wad -file sod.wad "
  
  If you aren't using boom, replace boom with the name of your source port of choice.

Authors comments    : This is a remake of an old map of mine made several years ago.
                      I really liked the original's layout and theme while it lacked
                      in gameplay and texturing aspects. The confined spaces should

Authors comments    : I've always wanted to do a remake of Alien Vendetta's Hillside
                      Siege with my own twist. The most crucial aspect of the map
                      is the layout and architecture which I wanted to emphasise
                      in this remake. Certainly one of my favourites in this megawad.

                      so I was trying to recreate. The blue key room is from dream
                      and towers with cacodemons + imps are also and revenant snipers.

                      a theme to combine all 3, the result: Simple Prison-Yard.

                      into some stereotype with those spectacular brown+green sceneries.
                      They really are beautiful but I think that he should try also some
                      different styles... Perhaps some large indoor storehouse/outside buildings..." 
                      So I made a large indoor storehouse. Thanks for inspiration, Gusta! =)

[5] BUGS
--------

   There are several maps in this megawad that will slow down your framerate. It varies with what port
   you are playing with. Zdoom and Skulltag's are noticably the worst affected so for those maps, please
   do consider playing with Glboom or Prboom+ (complevel -9) as they handle the maps quite well and has
   mostly minimal lags.

   As for other bugs I hope there aren't anymore apart from perhaps some harmless trails if there are any.

[6.2 Music Track Notes]

** Stuart Rynn **

 Surface.mid (Map01):
    A simple piece, based on a simple chord progression, which I soon ran out of ideas
    for variation.

 Cold Wires.mid (Map03): 
    This was one of those midis where even as I was notating the initial inspiration
    (the first few bars), I was thinking 'This piece is never going to work. This theme
    is way too lame.' The section starting 0:46 I thought was fairly lazy of me, because
    the chord progression there is what I regard as a sort of cliche in music, especially
    mine. I couldn't think of any other way to continue the piece though, so it was pretty
    much my last resort. I like the way the overall piece turned out though, and I think
    it fits the map quite well.

 Core.mid (Map09):
    This was one of my first pieces contributed to this project. The start is supposed to
    mix drum sets, but because I was still fairly new to midi I didn't do it right, so it
    doesn't show. I prefer it this way though.

 Wash.mid (Map15):
    The idea for this came to me on the train, for some reason. The initial midi for this
    was about 1:50 in length, but I extended it just for the sake of it. At 2:16 I'm
    resorting to that old chord trick again. I really hate myself for doing that. :(

 Getaway.mid (Map16):
    This was also one of my first midis contributed. It's my least favourite out of practically
    all the midis I've ever made. It sounds kind of loosely stitched together, with lots of
    copy and paste. I also dislike most of the tunes in it. Oh well.

 Night Run.mid (Map17):
    This one's from Plutonia 2 but I'll write something on it anyway. The initial idea came
    from sitting at an empty score in Sibelius, and deciding "I'm going to make a piece that
    starts with slow strings." Those are pretty much the exact words I said to myself, and the
    piece sort of grew out of that. I like it.

 Lava's Edge.mid (Map21):
    This one was also one of the first pieces I contributed. I don't have much to say on it
    except that I was pretty lazy while making it - just copy-pasting the same chord progression
    a couple times.

 Cavern.mid (Map24):
    This one, unlike all of the others, was made after I'd played the map, so it was one of
    the last midis that I made. The initial 'inspiration' for this was similar to Night Run
    - "Let's have the strings play a note for a while and see where that gets us."

 Deep Forest.mid (Map25):
    I have no idea how this one started or what inspired it. I wish I'd actually noticed that
    copy-pasting the piano motif from one chord progression into another wouldn't necessarily
    fit with the latter progression, which is why the piano is still playing in E minor while
    the rest of the piece is playing in F or C sharp. Luckily I noticed it eventually, and
    actually modified the piano to fit in with the rest of the instruments - I forgot about
    changing it in the initial sections though.

 Weird.mid (Map26): 
    Erm, what can I say about this one? It's kinda weird, that's about it. I think I was just
    putting in random chords and notes and hoping to stumble on a combination that worked - which
    I think it did, in the end.

 Fall of the Kingdom.mid (Map27):
    Ah, yes. The longest midi I've ever made, at the time of writing - one of the requirements
    for it is that it should be 'long', IIRC. I had just recently discovered the gunshot sound,
    and how to easily change the volume in Sibelius, so I kinda combined them for this. Along
    the way I also discovered that combining instruments with one slightly delayed could create
    some cool effects. I guess this piece was sort of one big experiment for me. Some themes in
    it, eg 1:24 - 1:37, have been recycled in several of my more recent midis as well.

 Jailbreak.mid (Story/Map33):
    The drum pattern that inspired this song (which can be heard almost immediately in it) comes
    from an exercise that my drum teacher taught me. I quite like this piece, but after listening
    to it a lot I think I could have improved it. Dunno how, but I'm sure I could have.

 Drips.mid (Map08):
    This one is also fairly weird. I can't say much more about it.

 Egypt.mid (Map32):
    This was the first midi that I submitted. It originally ended at 1:43 but I extended this one
    as well. This is one of my favourites.

 Siege.mid (Title):
    Part of this song was inspired, if unconsciously, by the song in Gex 1 that plays in the dome.
    For those of you who have never heard of Gex, well, too bad. I can't think of anything else to
    say about this.

 Harmless.mid (Intermission):
    This song wasn't initially made for Speed of Doom - it was made back in about 2006-2007, so it's
    one of my earliest works, and I think shows that I was still getting used to Sibelius even then.


** James Paddock **

 Warsword (Map05)
    This is like a remix of some kind of "Excalibur" by Lee Jackson (used in ROTT). That song was used for
    the Hillside Siege map (MAP06) in Alien Vendetta, which the map that this song is for was based on...
    if that makes sense. It uses virtually the same structure as the original (which I had on hand while
    making this) so the similarity is COMPLETELY obvious. Although you *may* get a slight surprise at the
    last section as it introduces something that wasn't in the original (per Joshy's request :P). I also
    made this song while I was sick as hell. I get inspirational bursts when I'm suffering from crippling
    colds? :S Meh, enjoy anyway. :P

 Rusty Nails (Map07)
    This song was actually written for a SEKRIT project, but the guy heading it said that he wanted a more
    ambient style of track. By this point this song was already finished, so I turned it over to Joshy to
    see if he wanted it. He did, so it became part of the Speed of Doom soundtrack! This turned out to be
    more repetitive in the beginning than I thought, but about halfway through it really picks up.
    Definitely one of my better ones.

 Unknown Organism (Map29)
    This one is definitely something that I'm not used to doing. Creepy church organs and weird pizzicato
    strings are certainly something I've tried before (I do love the way Blood's soundtrack used them)
    but they are actually quite tricky to nail. The chords I had to be especially careful with, trying to
    make them sound slightly discordant and yet effective at the same time. To a certain extent I think I
    succeeded, but I'll leave that to you to judge. This is possibly the most repetitive song in the
    project, although I don't know for sure because I've not heard the complete soundtrack just yet. :P
    Oh yea and "organism" is like "church organ" HURRRRR im so good at namin stuff :V

 Baron's Province (Map30)
    Originally this song was meant to be for a "devilish unholy cathedral with evil choir tunes" and
    "very abstract and evil". It started out as such (I made the piano bit first and added the choir
    chords on after that), but gradually, it evolved into something extremely similar to 
    "Terror's Loft"/"Triangle of Fear" by Mark Klem (which is a great song, by the way), so much so
    that I had to make sure it wasn't directly copying from the song in any way. You will definitely
    smell inspiration/nigh-plagiarism on hearing it and the song consecutively, though. Overall I think
    this is a satisfying track to listen to, those muted guitars being my favorite part, but may have
    grown a bit too repetitive. Key changes, ahoy! :P

 Great Hall (Map23)
    Probably the one that took the most effort to finish. I wanted to make it sound as effective as
    possible for its specification ("Scythe 2's Map25 [...] a ripoff of the vine temple theme"), and
    that resulted in me going back to a lot of its individual sections and making the riffs sound as
    "complete" as I deemed it necessary. In fact, in order to do so, I played through Brotherhood of
    Ruin maps with this song to see if it fit, and from these playthroughs I concluded that more needed
    to be going on in the song. So, in a moment of desperation I just kept on adding more and more stuff
    to the sections over and over until I was finally happy. By that point I'd run out of creative steam,
    so this song is, while still at a quite satisfactory length of 3:36, could of course have been longer
    (and looped better). Still, I think the effort was worth it and overall it works the way it was
    intended. Whooo. :)
