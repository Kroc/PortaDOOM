                          Jimmy is a pretty cool guy. Eh, makes really good
                          music and doesn't afraid of anything.

                          We apologize for using this meme. Maybe.

Description             : After a loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
                          delay, the second episode (sorta) of the long-
                          awaited (sorta) TurboCharged ARCADE! is here (sorta)!
                          Venture across the mountainous realms of the Himalayas
                          and the lava fields of Hell. Witness epic spectacles
                          such as massive exploding barrel structures and
                          semi-monumental wedding chapels. In The Sequel Episode,
                          you do it all, from raiding a Museum to smashing
                          yourself against rockets to bounce them into colored
                          (and often deadly) blocks. And before it's all said
                          and done, better prepare yourself for an epic showdown
                          with The Man himself, (an acronym of) Satan.

                          For those not in the know, TcA is a humorous adventure
                          revolving around short, wacky levels where everything
                          operates at 200% speed. Enemies, weapons, you name it!
                          It's quicker, faster, deadlier and funnier.

                          The Sequel Episode sports eight more maps of awesome
                          from insanity masterminds Xaser and Jimmy, which may
                          or may not be fit for human consumption (not that it
                          matters to most humans anyway).
