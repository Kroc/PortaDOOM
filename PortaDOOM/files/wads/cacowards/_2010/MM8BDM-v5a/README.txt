| INTRODUCTION |
X==============X

Welcome to Mega Man 8-bit Deathmatch! The first and greatest free Mega Man First Person
Shooter to grace the web!

MM8BDM is a modification created for the Skulltag engine, which is a port of Doom2 with
enhanced features. The game includes over 50 8-bit themed maps based on Robot Master
levels from the Mega Man series, over 50 weapons from the games, over 50 playable skins
based on the characters from the Mega Man series, and so much more! The best part? It's
compeltely free! Created by the fans, for the fans.

It's taken us just under a good year to put this all together. We've come a long way 
since the buggy alpha that first gave the game attention to the public. Capcom should 
be proud of all the Mega Man fans out there, who love the classic series so much. I
hope that this game helps them understand that the classic series still has potential,
and that we'll buy Mega Man 11 and onward as long as they keep making them as fun,
enjoyable and retro as they always have been.

I would like to thank the MM8BDM team, and my small (but growing) community for making 
this small dream a reality. Without these guys, I probably would have thrown in the 
towel a very long time a go. We hope you enjoy this game as much as we enjoyed making it.

Fight Mega Man, for everlasting peace!

| INSTALLATION |
X==============X

Installation is simple. Open up the MM8BDM zip file (most likely you already have it open
if you're reading this) and extract its contents into a new directory (e.g C:/MM8BDM).

If you downloaded this with Zandronum already packed, you're done! If not, you'll have to
grab it from http://zandronum.com/.

To start the game, run MM8BDM.exe to start the launcher!

If you get stuck, drop me a line (see contact information below) or visit our forums
at http://cutstuff.net/forum

X==============X
| SINGLEPLAYER |
X==============X

Hitting singleplayer will boot the game in offline mode. The game should open up and 
the intro should play. Hit ESC to access the menu (you can do this at any time).

Select the START option and then SINGLEPLAYER to begin the game for the first time.

You should be greeted by Dr. Light who will explain the basics and let you set up
your controls. From here you can practice your movement and check out the rest of
Dr. Light's lab.

The main game includes 10 chapters, each chapter representing a game from the classic
Mega Man series. Each chapter has 8-10 maps where you fight a number of bots. You 
must win each match to proceed through the chapter. At the end of each chapter you
fight a special boss. If you win, you return to the lab.

PLEASE NOTE that the RESTORE and SAVE functions do not work correctly in MM8BDM.
The game is automatically saved after each chapter. The game is also loaded 
automatically when loading singleplayer again.

Ready to blast other Mega Man fans online? Here's how you do it.

JOINING A SERVER
----------------

If you run the launcher you'll find a tutorial on how to download and install the
launcher called Doom Seeker. While you can join servers using Skulltag's internal
browser, DoomSeeker has many more features and is generally more reliable.

You can find the tutorial here: http://cutstuff.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=728

HOSTING A SERVER
----------------

The MM8BDM launcher includes a primitive (but functional) server launcher under the host
tab. The application is fairly self explanitary. Just make sure that if you're behind a
router that your port is open!

You can find the tutorial here: http://cutstuff.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=750

I would recommend DoomSeeker too, as it has more options (including the ability to add
custom modifications to the server).

ALL CHARACTERS AND GRAPHICS COPYRIGHT (C) CAPCOM

You can view the credits for this game via the ingame menu. I will list here everyone's
skin contributions to the game as they required the most work to do. Don't forget each
Robot Master skin contains 37 frames of animation, most which were NOT included in
the Mega Man games (a lot of Robot Masters jumped rather than walked) so they had to be
invtented for the game.

If you plan on using any of these sprites, please do the right thing and credit the 
person who made them. These guys put thier heart and soul into bringing their favourite
Robot Masters to MM8BDM. Seriously. These guys rock!
