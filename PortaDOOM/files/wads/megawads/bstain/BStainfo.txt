[1] INTRODUCTION
----------------

Bloodstain is a full 32-map megawad for Doom2 made by Pavel TvrznÌk,
Czech Doom mapper known in the Doom community as Pipicz (that means
me :-)

Bloodstain's map format is limit-removing Doom2. I recommend playing
with complevel 2, although it can certainly be played on other comp-
levels too.

Testing was carried out in PrBoom-Plus 2.5.1.3 on complevel 2 and
ZDoom 2.3.1 with Doom (strict) compatibility settings. Full comp-
atibility and therefore functionality in other ports and other
compatibility settings isn't assured.

Bloodstain also uses Boom-compatible DEHACKED lump that
 

[1.1 Cooperative]

Player starts only. I'm not saying it's unplayable in Coop, but it
certainly isn't designed for it and bugs or gameplay-related prob-
lems are certainly present.


[1.2 Deathmatch]

Not even player starts. Who would bother with implementing DM into
SP megawad nowadays, right? :-)


[1.3 Compatibility]

Bloodstain requires a port to run as the format is limit-removing
Doom2 (except for MAP30 which is Boom). It also uses DEHACKED lump.


[1.4 Resources]
 
Bloodstain was compiled with textures from the following sources:

Ultimate Doom
Heretic & Hexen
Quake & Quake 2
Final Doom
Requiem
Alien Vendetta
Plutonia 2
Scythe 2
Speed of Doom
5th Episode Texture Pack
Gothic Texture Pack
DarkBase Texture Pack
Doom Potpourri Texs
Recolored Doom Texture Pack

+ it is quite possible I have forgot about something, in such case
  I apologize and please let me know and I'll add whatever is mis-
  sing :-)


[1.5 Additional Graphics]

TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, CREDIT, BOSSBACK, M_DOOM

Statusbar - based on original Doom2 textures
          - big Statusbar numbers come from Scythe 2

Regarding textures, there are a few, but they are mostly based on
already existing textures by various authors.


[1.6 MIDI music]

lected from various sources (origin of some is unknown or I don't
simply remember it, in that case I'm sorry; if you recognize any of
those tracks, please let me know):

[2] STORY
---------

It ought to be just another boring workday of a UAC space marine.
You were sent to investigate what happened to a squad gone missing
while investigating a distress signal from a colony on Phobos.
However, upon arriving at the drop zone you notice something isn't
quite right. The missing squad can be seen shredded all over the
place. You grab your trusty pistol and go investigate.
 

----------------
[3] INSTALLATION
----------------

There are a few possible ways which all of you probably know:

1) Drag and drop BStain.wad onto a source port executable.

2) Type a command line into a .bat file:
   e.g.: "prboom.exe -iwad doom2.wad -file BStain.wad"

[4.2 Map Info]

MAP01
Name        : Inception
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Base
Inspiration : Scythe MAP01, KS2 MAP01
Comments    : Although this is MAP01, it by far isn't the oldest one.
              I wanted MAP01 to be a good-looking one, with catchy
              layout and fast-paced and straightforward gameplay.
              I consider this one to be an adequate introduction
              to the megawad.

MAP02
Name        : Brass Square
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Town
Inspiration : KS map01, AV map03
Comments    : An old and probably the smallest map in the whole mega-
              wad. A few buildings closing in on the square. Nothing
              special, really.

MAP03
Name        : Conquered Quarters
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Town
Inspiration : Various town-themed maps.
Comments    : Another fast-paced map with a central square and a few
              buildings around. Longer than the previous one, but still
              quite a short one. The secret with an SSG was changed
              from the Demo. Introduction of a new Z-Sec zombie at the
              map's ending.

MAP04
Name        : Fallout Shelter
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Doom 1 base
Inspiration : Ultimate Doom Episode 1
Comments    : The version released in the Demo felt a bit too much
              Doom 1-ish that it didn't really fit into the megawad's
              concept, so I decided to redo most of the second half
              of the map. Now I'm way more satisfied with it.

MAP05
Name        : The Intersection
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Doom 1 base
Inspiration : Ultimate Doom Episode 1
Comments    : When I think back, this might be the oldest map in the
              megawad. Quite many time redone and improved, of course.
              The basic layout idea remains the smae though.

MAP06
Name        : Anomaly Entrance
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Base, more in Scythe2 style
Inspiration : Scythe2 base maps
Comments    : First longer map requiring all three keys to finish.
              However it's not really complex and the pathway is rather
              straightforward from the start to the exit. It can be di-
              vided into four parts - mostly symmetrical central part
              that interconnects the other three parts, each one neces-
              sary to go through to get the key. The last part features
              the introduction of slightly modified Baron in a little
              and pretty easy boss fight to close up the first episode.

MAP07
Name        : The Amphitheater
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Neo-Plutonic arena
Inspiration : Various maps 07, AV map07 and KS map07 the most
Comments    : Gameplay-wise, it's not anyhow unusual map07. I wanted
              to have all the monsters teleport in and so I did. In
              the end it might look a bit awkward, but hey. Possibly the
              only gameplay element that could be considered innovative
              a little is that I used tags 666 and 667 to make a sort
              of waves of monster spawning right after killing the pre-
              vious wave.
              However what I am quite satisfied with is the color theme
              of the map - quite unusual combination of grey Plutonia
              bricks with green camo textures, grey marble, and sandy
              colours.              

MAP08
Name        : Toxic Sea
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Scythe2 base
Inspiration : Scythe2 base maps
Comments    : Another base-themed map, this time surrounded by the sea,
              as the title suggests, made of acid. Could be water, but
              hey, what would be the title then? The panorama features
              a steamship as a reference to AV map03 and some KS maps.
              And, if you look to the right while on the bridge leading
              to the exit tower, you'll be able to see a little wooden
              KS-style boat. :-)

MAP09
Name        : Mountain Outpost
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Mostly outdoor base with orange rock landscapes
Inspiration : Various base-themed maps
Comments    : The first map of the megawad using an open, complex and
              somewhat interconnected layout. I actually started draw-
              ing the map on the chequered paper and I think that is
              the reason why it turned this well. There are multiple
              possible routes to take while finishing the map and not
              all the areas need to be explored. However it is quite
              action packed, especially at the beginning and in the
              areas where you pick up any important item. I am really
              satisfied with it, both with its gameplay and color
              theme and looks.

MAP10
Name        : Shimmering Grotto
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Brown caverns
Inspiration : KS map05
Comments    : Quite an old one, originally with a different color
              theme in the outdoor areas. Before having been replaced
              by the darker brown textures the outdoor areas' texture
              was exclusively ROCK4. All in all, I'm glad I decided
              to use DB2's find and replace feature here. :-)
              The title comes from a Magic: the Gathering card.

MAP11
Name        : Verdant
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Green moss landscapes and caverns
Inspiration : Primarily a dream I had one night :-)
              besides that PL2 map16, SOD map17
Comments    : An idea for this map indeed came in a dream and I just
              had to hear out the inception. The dream did actually
              show only a bit with the cavern right after the opening
              valley where you start, but I made the whole map in this
              theme - with an intention to keep sort of dreamy feel
              for the whole map. I think that a few landmarks have turn-
              ed out quite nice, but I don't really like this map's
              layout and gameplay. It's basically just a tunnel that
              leads the player right from the start to the exit. 

MAP12
Name        : The Slimy Dens
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Brown stone
Inspiration : Doom2 map14, AV map05, Scythe map15
Comments    : Probably the second oldest map here - of course again
              changed and renovated a million times from its original
              version. The original version was pretty plain and ugly,
              but I had been a bit encouraged about this map by Gusta
              and MethoD when I was about 14 years old and in my map-
              ping beginnings.              

MAP13
Name        : Autumn
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Brown stone, orange rocks and leaves
Inspiration : PL2 map01, some Hexen maps that feature orange leaves
Comments    : I had always wanted to make a brown stone map with
              a significant Hexen orange leaf sub-theme that would
              be named Autumn (or somehow similar). This is the map.
              I think worked out pretty well. Many areas here are
              rather cramped but aesthetically good looking. Or at
              least in my book.
              The map's beginning is heavily influenced by the begin-
              ning of PL2 map01.

MAP14
Name        : Dryad's Garden
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Brown stone, green vines, green rocks
Inspiration : AV map05, Scythe2 maps 21-25
Comments    : Another map I don't like a lot. I was even considering
              cutting it out, but in the end I decided to keep it in.
              Although open in the design, the layout is a plain tun-
              nel - no complexity and only one route to take. Well,
              it just sucks, but there might at least be a few good-
              looking environments.

MAP15
Name        : Secluded Stronghold
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Outdoor open goth castle
Inspiration : Primarily Castle level from 2004 video game Painkiller,
              Scythe2 maps 01-05
Comments    : Rather atypical map. On automap it might look somewhat
              similar to MAP14, but actually is very different. At
              some poins in the past I disliked this map as well,
              but eventually I came to a conclusion that it is act-
              ually quite good, maybe mainly because of its rather
              unique open layout.
              I wanted to convey the feeling of mysteriousness of
              secret exit. So you can see the exit sign in the cent-
              ral keep, but you have to hunt down several switches
              on the castle walls and the red key to reach it.

MAP16
Name        : Malleus Maleficarum
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Gothic town
Inspiration : Town level from Painkiller, Scythe2 maps 01-05,
              some parts of KS map29
Comments    : I wanted to create a gothic/town-themed map inspired
              by the Town level from Painkiller, with the square that
              is in the above mentioned Painkiller level close to the
              end. The remake of the square makes a focal point of the
              map with two main routes leading from it and nearing the
              ending you have to come back. Again there are multiple
              routes to take.
              This is another example of a map where I used a chequer-
              ed paper to draw the layout - it helped especially in
              the eastern area that turned out pretty well imho.

MAP17
Name        : The Eerie Keep
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Gothic town, gothic castle
Inspiration : Mainly Bloodstain map16 - Malleus Maleficiarum :-)
              Besides that some Quake 1 maps, but none in particular
              And of course Bono Publico stairway in Hradec Kr·lovÈ 
              - see the comments.
Comments    : For quite a while I had wanted to make another map with
              gothic/town theme with a characteristic central part,
              this time inspired by an edifice in Hradec Kr·lovÈ,
              specifically Bono Publico, an indoor stairway that int-
              erconnects the town's main square with a not unimport-
              ant street. The part of the map inspired by it is the
              stairway corridor you are facing right at the start.
              Actually it is the first part of the map I made. And
              I was pretty sure I wanted to put those lanterns hang-
              ing from the ceiling there. :-) So I had to do some
              texture-making to achieve it, and luckily it turned
              out quite well. That's it about the stairway.
              Other than that, I'm really satisfied with this map.
              It is quite a complex multi-pathwayed one with many
              interconnections and some rooms whose design I'm really
              proud of - and outdoor areas I find even better. :-)

MAP18
Name        : Terracotta Palace
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Terracotta town and palace
Inspiration : Quake E1M5 and mainly E4M4
Comments    : I believe Doom really lacks Quake 1-style terracotta-
              themed maps badly. And I came to a conclusion Bloodstain
              needs one badly. This is it. I know that the texture
              inventory here is really thin, and some people may say
              that it would need some other textures to enliven it,
              but to use almost exclusively Quake's terracotta text-
              ures was actually my intention. Besides the texture
              choice, layout is rather open and again complex with
              various intercon nections.

MAP19
Name        : Icebreaker
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Ice and metallic base
Inspiration : Requiem map03, PL2 map25
Comments    : Started mainly as a snow-themed map, this one turned to
              have way more base in it that initially intended. The
              metallic sub-theme can be reminiscent of the maps ment-
              ioned above and to be honest, the two maps are probably
              the reason why I strayed to this theme. The metallic
              base building in the central area has some rather un-
              usual and nice structures in the roof parts or how would
              you call it.

MAP20
Name        : The Great Furnace
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Ice, grey caverns, metallic structures, lava
Inspiration : Fortress town from Heroes of Might & Magic V
Comments    : Although it might seem a bit strange, this map's aesthe-
              tics is really heavily influenced by Heroes V's Fortress
              town and its surroundings - sort of Nordic snowy land-
              scape at the beginning and a lot of lava are probably
              the first things the player notices in this map. Init-
              ially the caverns part was meant to look somewhat dif-
              ferent and mainly, the metallic forge part was intended
              to be more reminiscent of the Fortress town, being like
              a huge deep hole in the snowy landscape with the player
              descending deeper, but it would probably comprise game-
              play and layout problems, so I abandoned this idea.
              However, the map still contains a few rather unusual
              Doom engine tricks that can hopefully give joy to the
              player. Nearing the end there is a sort of BFG rape-fest,
              which is not really my style, but hey, it's the end of
              the episode.

MAP21
Name        : Gateway to Purgatory
-----------------------------------
Theme       : White hell, blood, dark castle
Inspiration : Ultimate Doom E4M6
Comments    : An opening of the third episode. The level starts in a
              white rocky crag, soon you encounter some hellish build-
              ings, nothing really special regarding the gameplay etc.
              But what I'm kinda proud of is the black cathedral where
              the level ends - especially the ceiling structure and
              the outer buttress.

MAP22
Name        : Chambers of Suffering
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Red hell, blood, dark castle
Inspiration : Various hellish-themed maps and Doom E3M4
Comments    : So, how Doom E3M4? Well, besides the name that pays a
              slight reference to 'House of Pain', this map contains
              three areas that are modern more hell-like remakes of
              the most defining (or at least in my opinion) areas
              from the above mentioned E3M4. Well, I kind of modif-
              ied them to my taste, but I think that they are rather
              recognizable than not. There are also a few 'execution
              devices' to kill Imps (to make the title more fitting
              :-)). The layout of this map isn't cool as it is total-
              ly straightforward map with no digressions.

MAP23
Name        : The Perdition
-----------------------------------
Theme       : White hell, blood, dark castle
Inspiration : Quake E1M5 and E4M4
Comments    : From red hell back to white hell. Once again, probably
              nothing in particular to say about this map. It's rather
              spontaneously made one. There are a few moments that can
              be memorable (usually when getting a key), but nothing
              that was really planned in advance. However, the map is
              not bad at all, I think.

MAP24
Name        : Sulfur
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Red hell, lava
Inspiration : KS map11, Scythe maps 21-24
Comments    : Well, again no really cool backstory about this map.
              I think that some paper-drawing preceded the process
              of making this map, but in the end it probably digressed
              a bit from it. But the intended idea of being mostly
              red rock outdoor map with some dark rock areas that inc-
              luded some heaps of sandy textures that should embody
              sulfur was accomplished. But many parts of this map
              were a result of spontaneous map-drawing.

MAP25
Name        : The Disciples of Babel
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Dark hellish town and palaces, bloody sewers
Inspiration : Various hellish castle-themed maps, Scythe2 map27 prob-
              ably the most
Comments    : This map I consider to be one of the two great master-
              pieces I made for Bloodstain. Huge, complex, detailed.
              It is likely to take an hour or more to finish.
              I wanted this map to be hellish but completely without
              the traditional use of ROCKRED texture. It had worked
              out really well in my opinion.
              Although very large map with quite many monsters and
              many possible routes to take, I invested a plenty of
              time into creating some rather nice sceneries. There
              are also a few tricks used that are really uncommon
              in Doom, for example fake second floor above the gate
              to the final arena or the exit lift, which is an effect
              cool as fuck in vanilla format imho.  
              The first room is in fact retextured version of the
              initial room from The Fallen, my map28 from Zones of
              Fear, but I started makind this map by redoing that
              room, so it is this map's heart, so to speak. :-)

MAP26
Name        : The Corrupted Mill
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Dark base, lava
Inspiration : Idoom mapping contest - Quake World map07, Plutonia
              map04, NDCP2 map01, some Doom 3 stuff too
Comments    : You return from Hell back to some darker and hellish
              base. The opening sequence is just run-through and
              then Tyson-like punch-out part in the sewers comes.
              It's not really easy, but it is doable.
              The part where you pick up the SSG and afterwards the
              yellow key was originally a bit cooler, with some pretty
              complicated tag combos that I couldn't believe were
              working. Then during the final testing with complevel 2
              I found out they don't work that well - actually not at
              all with complevel 2. So I had to redo the room a bit.
              Well, it's not that different and at least it does work.

MAP27
Name        : Slaughterworks
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Dark base, lava, flesh, blood
Inspiration : NDCP2 map01, PL2 map19 and 27
              The idea for the Arch-Vile resurrecting the dead army
              at the map's end comes from BTSX_E1 map06 
Comments    : Another map in dark base style, and quite a good one
              imho, not entirely whole in the same style.
              The last fight is quite unique I think. Not that mon-
              sters initially dead and then being reanimated by Arch-
              Viles is an idea of mine, as mentioned above, it was
              inspired by Back to Saturn X, but here it is a whole
              BFG rape-fest that carries out in this spirit.
              After the fight there originally was a little puzzle
              with a don't-step-on-the-wrong-tile puzzle, but I have
              come to a conclusion that it might be considered a
              little bit retarded thing to put into a Doom wad like
              this, so I removed it and just put timed doors there.

MAP28
Name        : Descent into Madness
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Flesh, blood, dark base
Inspiration : Phyrexia from Magic: the Gathering; Clive Barker's
              Jericho, Hellraiser films, The Fly; simply various
              body-horror films and other media that revolve around 
              combining flesh with metal;
              Idea for the portals comes from a map in Stronghold:
              On the Edge of Chaos.
Comments    : I wanted map28 to be a mixture of a dark metallic base
              and flesh, skin, and intestines textures. To look some-
              what Phyrexian, for those who have an idea what that
              means. :-D
              I also wanted to add a theme of warped reality to make
              the title more fitting. I achieved it by including those
              portals that embody sort of rifts between two dimensions.
              Another thing I must mention is the secret with the red
              key. I had carried an idea for it in my head for about
              two years before realizing it. I wanted to add a certain
              mysterious feel to it too as the red key allows you to
              get to a few other secret locations.
              The title comes from a Magic: the Gathering card.

MAP29
Name        : Ov Fire and the Void
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Black hell, lava
Inspiration : Doom 2 map29, Plutonia maps 23 and 27, Plutonia
              Revisited map23, Scythe2 map26, some Speed of Doom
              maps too I guess
              Besides the Doom maps, I think had been inspired by
              Underworld and Stone Pit levels from Painkiller:
              Battle out of Hell, and Doom 3 hell
              And I believe that some music I listened to at some
              points while creating the map inspired me quite a lot
              too - namely the bands are mainly Obscure Sphinx and,
              as the title implies, Behemoth; but I really adore these
              two bands anyway, but while listening to them I just got
              some good ideas and the mapping went really well :-)
Comments    : I had quite a clear idea about the theme of the last two
              maps of Bloodstain. I converted RROCK1 and ROCKRED text-
              ures to shades of gray and darkened them to get what you
              see all around you in these two maps. I certainly like
              this Black hell theme and I think it makes the megawad's
              ending a bit more unique than those mainstream REDROCK
              textures. :-) And darker too, of course. Which correla-
              tes with the _BLACK textures which invokes the feeling of
              total darkness and void. These dark textures are comb-
              ined with lava that adds some light to the darkness
              of black rock and black hellish buildings. Overall,
              I consider the name 'Ov Fire and the Void' to fit nicely.
              Or possibly that this map fits the name well? I'm not
              completely sure if the idea for the map's theme or deci-
              sion to name the map after that wonderful Behemoth song
              came first. Be it one way or the other, I find this map
              epic as fuck and I'm really proud of it. Maybe even more
              than of map25. :-)

MAP30
Name        : The Deepest Abyss
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Black hell
Inspiration : Mostly Bloodstain map29 I suppose :-)
              And various maps 30 probably, Plutonia2 the most I guess 
Comments    : I wanted to have the final map in the same style as map29
              but even a little bit darker, so to speak. That has been
              for certain for quite a long time. However, one thing I
              wasn't really sure before finishing the map was its form-
              at. I had an idea of making it in Boom format to have
              conveyor belts for voodoo dolls at disposal to be able
              to make various tag sequences, but in the end I abandon-
              ed this idea, both for the consistency of the megawad,
              and because I kind of lost inspiration. Or because I
              was lazy or something. I don't know... :-D But the fact
              is that it stayed in limit-removing Doom2 format, maybe
              for the best.
              After short intro-part you get to dark ruins filled with
              Arch-Viles, where you have to find eight switches for
              the main switch to do something and then you teleport
              to the final arena.
              Regarding the boss fight, I initially wanted something
              more unique, but ended up creating just another Icon of
              Sin variant... hopefully not so dull, there is no lift
              and Icon of Sin you must shoot into DBRAIN1-filled hole
              in the middle of its forehead, but it definitely isn't
              anything hyper-miraculous. :-D I just had an idea about
              needing to get all three keys and then nothing really
              special I think. Well, I've definitely seen worse boss
              fights... :-D
              By the way, if you are interested, check the inside of
              the boss's head... :-)

MAP31
Name        : Labyrinthe
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Hedge maze, underground tunnels
Inspiration : Hedge maze is probably mostly inspired by the hedge maze
              at Lara Croft's mansion from Tomb Raider II :-)
              Besides that the maze from Harry Potter and the Goblet
              of Fire movie :-D
              Underground tunnels are inspired by various dungeons
              from Might & Magic series
Comments    : Yup, I wanted to make a map containing a hedge maze;
              at the beginning you can see what seems to be the exit
              from the maze, but when you reach it, well, you'll see-
              Once again, I wanted the super secret exit to exert sort
              of mysterious influence and look epic. Hopefully, I've
              succeeded. :-)

MAP32
Name        : Heavenly
-----------------------------------
Theme       : Heaven :-)
Inspiration : Might & Magic VIII - Plane of Air
Comments    : Yup, really Heaven. When you play it in a port that sup-
              ports MAPINFO it's fine. But e.g. in PrBoom there is
              a problem - I didn't find out if it's possible to change
              the sky texture in Doom2 format using DeHackEd. But if
              you can cope with the sky in Heaven being red as in
              whole Episode 3, then enjoy those happy-looking textures
              and structures :-)
              BTW I know I could've squeezed more out of it, but I
              somehow found this theme somewhat weird to follow. Maybe
              with a wider texture inventory and if more monsters fit
              there it could be better, but dunno. I kind of lost
              my imaginativness here... :-)

[5] BUGS
--------

There shouldn't be any severe bugs as long as you use the recommended
complevels/compatibility settings.
The best complevel that has been tested is -complevel 2. I can't gua-
rantee the proper functioning for other complevels.
As for ZDoom compatibility settings I recommend Doom (strict).

If you encounter any bugs you consider relevant, please feel free to
let me know :-)

Thanks to everyone who supported me during this looooooooooooong
mapping journey. Also thanks to everyone who has playtested my
wad and gave recommendations (that I had't always heeded :-)) or
pointed out any errors.
Also thanks to everyone for playing it and for any feedback :-)
And, if you feel like supporting my cause and encouraging me
in further investing my time into mapmaking (as this megawad sure
has taken me a few thousand hours to finish, and that's not over-
exaggerating), I'm certainly not going to discourage you from any
potential donation! :-D
