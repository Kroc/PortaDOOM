Misc. Author Info       : Is a rare bipedal cacodemon. 

Description             : It's a sad life on the Space Marine IT Help Desk.
                          Especially when you're stuck on the graveyard
                          shift.  Night after night of "Did you try
                          rebooting?"  Not exactly what you expected when
                          you signed up.

                          You figured this call would be more of the same:
                          some garbled voice mail about "gremlins in the
                          system".  Gremlins?  Seriously, how old is the
                          guy who left that?  Ninety five?  He probably
                          remembers vacuum tubes.

                          Now you're here though, something isn't right.  
                          This facility should be busy, but it's silent.
                          Almost desolate.  You're starting to feel glad
                          you brought that popgun they issued you with to
                          make you look like a real soldier ...

* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : MAP01-32
                          Every map was built with 404 lines or fewer, as a
                          nod to the project name, to keep the map design 
                          focused on the key concept for each level, and to
                          make sure I didn't spend hours and hours noodling
                          with detail.
Single Player           : Designed for. Both continuous and pistol start
                          play is supported. Play however you prefer. Pistol
                          start is naturally a bit more difficult.  Note
                          that for story reasons, 2 maps have death exits.
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Supported
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Supported (intended for original deathmatch with
                          no monsters; I've tried to do more than
                          just dumping DM starts in there)
Other game styles       : No
Difficulty Settings     : Yes


* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : Quite some time 
Editor(s) used          : Doom Builder 2, GZDoomBuilder
Known Bugs              : MAP07 - if you play deathmatch with monsters on,
                          this map will break.  It is also likely to be
                          problematic in Nightmare difficulty.
                          MAP29 - you can get killed by the exit, depending
                          on where you stand.  Just don't press 'use' and
                          you will go on to map30 (pistol start, but trust
                          me, it's only marginally tougher that way).
May Not Run With        : The original German IWAD
