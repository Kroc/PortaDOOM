THE STORY:
==========

The government, in its infinite wisdom, reopened the Mars project. The same
tired old assurances given by the same tired old politicians ring hollow.
"This time it's different", they said. "We will no longer teleport in space.
Instead, we will teleport in time."

Right. As if that made any damn difference.

As the boundaries of time were broken down by earth's best scientists the
children of Hell eyed a new way into man's domain. Not long after the first
successful experiments, the first deformed shape stepped out from the
spinning blue void of the time gate.

History's worst nightmare revisited; demonic invasion.

This is why you exist. A warrior, bred for combat, ready to trade your life
for earth's safety. You and your comrades have at least learned from your
superiors' catastrophic past endeavors. And so you fought, and were
repelling the invasion once more.

Or so it seemed...

Alas, Hell had also gained wisdom from the last war. Now, while the marines
are slaughtering and being slaughtered, the rulers of hell use the captured
time gate to slip into earth's past. If they can't defeat the humans of the
presence, then at least their medieval ancestors will be easy prey...

Earth's past is about to be shaped by demons...

Your platoon's briefing is simple, your mission suicidal:

Use stealth and firepower to infiltrate the time gate complex. You will
deploy a set of teleporters to get as close as possible to the infected
gate.  Still, several hell-spawn strongholds will be between you and the
time-rift.  When you have secured the gate, follow the demons into the
vortex, back to the dark ages. Of what awaits you there little is known,
other than this:

This is not just a deadly threat to the billions currently populating
earth.  It is much more; All previous generations will perish if Hell
wins our past.  The word "human" will be eradicated from existence!!!

If you fail to destroy all of Hell's strongholds and eradicate all demons
you need not look for a way back home;

There will be hell to pay...

(of course something goes wrong with the teleporters and only you come out
alive on the other side, pistol in hand ;)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

File Name              : E3UPG.ZIP or ETERNAL.ZIP

HD Requirements        : ~30 MB once completely installed.
                         ~50 MB required for installation of revisions (if any)

System Requirements    : Pentium or high-end DX2 recommended.

New art                : Some of the things we've added to Doom2 were
                         snatched from other sources (i.e. Hexen) but by far
                         the greater part of the new stuff is original art.

Play modes             : Eternal Doom was specifically designed for engrossing
                         single-player games. If you have powerful systems you
                         might want to try it out in co-op but deathmatch is
                         definitely not recommended.  Some levels can lead to
                         unresolvable situations in coop, Map02, Map 23, and
                         Map32 in particular. There may also be HOMS in co-op
                         mode that are impossible to view in single-player.Some
                         levels are also too large to save at start in co-op
                         mode due to added multiplayer support.

Difficulty Settings    : Implemented and thoroughly tested.

Demos Replaced         : Demos are included, built-in and full solutions. The
                         demos are converted to your DOOM version as part of
                         installation.

Build Time             : We didn't call it "Eternal" just for fun you know.
                         Don't expect to play it much faster than we wrote it
                         either!

Bugs                   : No bugs known at the time of release. Feel free to
                         report bugs if you should be better at finding them
                         than us. The fact that the level names on the automap
                         remain unchanged is not a bug, but a simplification.
