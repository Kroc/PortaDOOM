Overview:
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
 This DeHackEd patch is for "Eternal Doom III"
 using "DOOM II" version 1.9 or "Final DOOM"
 version 1.9.

Installation:
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
 A basic understanding of the operation of
 DeHackEd is required to use this DeHackEd patch.
 You MUST select the "Make IWAD" option from
 within the ๎ternal Doom III shell (ALT-F/Make
 IWAD). You MUST ALSO copy the DeHackEd patched
 DOOM2.EXE file and the DEFAULT.CFG file to your
 \ETERNAL directory. If you're using "Final DOOM"
 version 1.9 for DOS ("TNT: Evilution" or "The
 Plutonia Experiment") as your base IWAD with
 "Eternal Doom III", you will need version 3.1 of
 DeHackEd to apply this patch! Regular "DOOM II"
 (version 1.9) will work with DeHackEd version
 3.0a.

Things that will be modified in ๎ternal Doom III:
ฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤฤ
 1: The startup screen's text has been modified.

 2: When you hit <tab> to go to map view from
    within the game, the text will now reflect
    the ๎ternal Doom III level's name.

 3: The cheat codes have been modified. Simply
    type "TE" for the prefix of the cheat instead
    of "ID" (i.e. "TEBEHOLD").

 4: The "BEHOLD" menu has been modified slightly
    to make more sense.

 5: All of the "between episode" screen's text
    has been modified.

 6: Other miscellaneous game text has been
    modified.

*Note:
 Bear in mind that all of the playability of the
 game will be the same, only certain text and
 cheat codes have been modified.


Enjoy!
