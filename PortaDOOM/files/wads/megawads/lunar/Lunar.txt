* Play Information *

Game                    : Doom
Map #                   : E1M1-E4M9

This wad is intended to be played without jumping or crouching!

Each level contains deathmatch spawns, and some levels contain multiplayer tagged
weaponry for deathmatch and co-op purposes. The entire wad is 
mapped with co-op in mind, so hopefully there should never be any issues 
with getting locked out of areas or being unable to progress because someone 
died. However, not every damaging pit can be climbed out of once you fall in, 
so watch out!

Each level has its own par time as well!

* Construction *

Base                    : New from scratch
Build Time              : About 2 years off and on (see below)
Editor(s) used          : DoomBuilder, Gimp, Paint and DoomWord
Known Bugs              : None that we know of aside from the occasional slimetrail
Tested With             : ZDoom

These maps are without a doubt strongly influenced by the original game. We aimed to emulate 
each developer's mapping style when appropriate and the overall feeling of playing the original 
Doom, but of course we took some liberties along the way and added in our own touches. We hope you 
enjoy the levels! 

Let us know what you think over at Doomworld!
