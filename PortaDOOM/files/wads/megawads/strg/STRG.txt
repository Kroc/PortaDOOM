                          DeHacked patch. Some of original monsters are also

                          [IMPORTANT] This wad uses heavily modified DeHacked
                          patch. So it is recommended not to use other custom
                          gameplay patches.
                          
                          P.S.: Par time is based on UV-MAX, not UV-Speed

The newsflash reports that the demonic invasion is suddenly begun.
Millions of people were killed within less than an hour, and it's getting worse.
You pick up your pistol & hammer, and see what's actually going on out there.
You better struggle yourself to live than just stay at home during the invasion... I guess?

= Levels (with one-line commentary) =

Episode 1 - The Catastrophe Begins

MAP01: At the Entrance
- A simple, straightforward opener for a full megawad.

MAP02: Ready to Survive
- Used to have a problem with navigating around in the early version.

MAP03: 3rd Supply Depot
- One of two levels that were salvaged from Catastrophe (2013); the scrapped megawad project long ago.

MAP04: Local Outpost
- A tribute to the second level I've ever created in 2006, which was MAP02 of Catastrophe (2006. yes, there are two of them.).

MAP05: Sewage Treatment
- An another level from Catastrophe (2013). Remember that Cyberdemons also shoot the same rockets as yours.

MAP06: Meet the Afriest
- I hope you like blue textures. Spoiler alert for the final episode.

MAP07: Point Foxtrot Tango
- I apologize in advance for using tag 666/667 in MAP07.

MAP08: A Forgotten Base
- I stopped mapping and made the exit, because I was running out of ideas.

MAP09: Spectre Strikes
- Remember, there are no pinky spectres in this wad. Mind the spectrocacos.

MAP10: Cerulean Ophidians
- You can call them Ophidians, instead of Antaresias, if you want.

MAP11: The Indomitable Mastermind
- Arch-viles can resurrect Spider Masterminds in this wad.


Episode 2 - Two Gateways to Inferno

MAP12: Into the Danger
- I apologize in advance again for a mediocre name of the level.

MAP13: Military Base
- It has a shooting range, to inform you that this is a military base.

MAP14: A Ticket from Inferno
- You need to press both Unit Switches to get a yellow keycard.

MAP15A: Teleportation Delta
- Used to have 665 monsters on UV.

MAP15B: Scorching Flames
- It was my #1 favorite unusual effect in Team Fortress 2.

MAP15C: The Leviathan
- Based on the concept of the final level of Catastrophe (2013).

MAP16: Return to Earth
- I expanded the idea of this level, and made The Kerberos Complex for DMP2017.

MAP17: Infinity Edge
- It has some miniatures of real life landmarks, and even a battleship.

MAP18: Point Lima Foxtrot
- Seriously, who's idea to put BFG for the first time in MAP18?

MAP19: Teleportation Theta
- Remember, those afriest turrets are indestructible. Don't try to shoot them.

MAP20: Chorok Yeonok
- It means "Green Purgatory" in korean. I hope you like green textures.


Episode 3 - Antaresian Legacy

MAP21: The Overture
- I hope you like blue textures. I really hope so.

MAP22: Afriests' Seminary
- I hope you like Afrie... nevermind.

MAP23: Rhabdophis Tigrinus
- The name was from a snake, that nearly freaked me out while I was planting dummy mines near the DMZ.

MAP24: The Lost Temple
- This level introduces Antaresia Elite, which is basically a combination of Antaresia and Evil Marine from Scythe 2.

MAP25: Druidia Borealis Sanctum
- The name has references from Skyroads, Half-Life 2, and even Doom (2016).

MAP26: Leviathan's Hideout
- I became a fan of dome structure, after I designed Alpha Scorpii Supercluster for Nova 3.

MAP27: Legions against One
- Ran out of ideas for mapping, so I just made three symmetric rooms with a full of demons.

MAP28: The Antaropolis
- Inspired by "The Hags Finger" from Sunder. It also has an optional wad with less details; STRG_M28.wad.

MAP29: Alpha Scorpii Monument
- A tribute to "Misri Halek" from Alien Vendetta; my all-time favorite Doom level. It also has a super secret.

MAP30: Ignis ex Antaresia
- Par time is one minute, even shorter than the first level. Good luck.
