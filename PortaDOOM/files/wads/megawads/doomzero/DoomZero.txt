Description             : A concept of a possible third installment in Final
                          Doom. Fully DOS compatible. Doom Zero brings things
                          back to the basics and expands on the gameplay
                          without requiring an advanced modern source port.
                          
                          The maps follow a philosophy of level design that
                          was practiced by the original authors of Doom
                          without blatantly copying elements of said authors,
                          and also putting a little more emphases on level
                          navigation and puzzle solving.


--- How to launch ---   : For source ports:
			  use both DOOMZERO.WAD and DOOMZERO.DEH.
			  It won't run properly without the DEH file.
			  
			  For MS-DOS:
			  type DOOMZERO then press Enter
			  (version 1.9 of Doom2.wad is requred, 
			   even for Chocolate Doom users)

			  DoomZeroHQMusic.WAD is optional for better music.
