Description           : TNT: Revilution is a fan made community project that acts as a
                        sequel to TeamTNT's Evilution. The goal of this project was to
                        capture the spirit of what made Evilution so great, while at
                        the same time bringing the quality of the visuals & game play
                        up to modern standards.

========================================================================================
With the death of the Demon-Spitter, the army of the damned loses their gateway to our
world, and they slowly evaporate around you, writhing with screams of agony. Then,
everything is silent, and the hellish red sky and the stench of sulfur fade away almost
as if nothing had ever happened at all.

Have you won? Is this another victory for mankind? No, something isn't right, there's a
blue glow coming from the inside of the Demon-Spitter's head. You crawl into the now
exposed brain and find a mix of technology and organic material fused so that you can't
tell where one stops and the other begins. The glow is coming from a nearby computer
panel. A look of horror spreads across your face as you realize what has happened: by
killing the Demon-Spitter, you have activated some sort of locating device. Now an even
bigger fleet of ships full of demons is on its way to Io.

The yearly supply ship from Mars is still weeks away from your position. Looks like
you're the only one standing between the demons and Earth. There's no way for you to
make a stand at the now completely destroyed UAC base, so you head for a nearby thermal
power station that taps into one of Io's many active volcanoes. Since it's several
miles' walk, you need to travel light. Looks like you'll only be taking your pistol for
protection, but hopefully you'll resupply on weapons before the demons arrive.

Hours later, you find yourself at the walls of the power station. Suddenly you hear
rumbling from above, and a great explosion fills the sky as the moon Ganymede explodes
into several pieces. Once the dust clears, you see a great skull where the moon used to
be. A fleet of hell ships materialize from the skull. Most of the ships head on a course
for Earth, but one heads directly for your position. So much for finding weapons before
they arrive. It's up to you to make it to the Communications Center before the demons
destroy the satellite array so that you can send a message to Earth warning humanity of
its impending Doom. Good luck, marine.
