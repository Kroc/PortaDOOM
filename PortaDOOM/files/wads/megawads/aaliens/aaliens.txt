Description             : Demos recorded with the original release of Ancient Aliens are compatible with this update.
			  Version 1.1 includes updates to textures. Version 1.2 includes an update to fix a MAP24 crash 
			  in Eternity caused by mistakenly rebuilding the nodes in MAP24.

			  Ancient Aliens is a megawad featuring 32 colorful,
                          action-packed maps for Boom compatible ports.
                          
                          Go on a journey to discover the truth about the 
                          enigmatic origins of human civilization... 
                          
                          I'm not saying it was aliens, but... the truth
                          is out there.
						  
						  

===========================================================================

Port Differences        : ZDoom-based ports and Eternity use MAPINFO for
                          episode selection and story screens.
                          
                          Additionally, in Zdoom-based ports and Eternity,
                          ACS is used to play sound effects occasionally.
                          This is way more cool than it sounds.

Additional Credits and Special Thanks
from lupinx-Kassman  	: Thanks to Skillsaw for helping finish the map when the deadline was looming. 
			  He designed the areas starting from the red key door which includes the windy bridge and islands connected to it, 
			  the vile fight arena in the "lower" section of the level, 
			  the set of ring teleports in the lower section that lead to the exit, and the exit staircase
			  arena with the revenants that leads to the final arena along with the surrounding UFOs. 
			  He also retextured various areas, made gameplay additions and fixes, and
			  added extra detail throughout the map. And though I added the saucer intro, the saucer design is based on his 
			  numerous saucers throughout the megawad. Thanks to Jim Flynn, Bob Reganess, and Roger Ritenour who were major influences
			  for me at the time. The first mega armor platform after ascending the rope is a rough reference to the megasphere lift 
			  in Jim Flynn's "Trapped on Titan" map. The "Aboo Ocean" name in MAP24's intro blurb is a reference 
			  to aboocean.wad (the filename for Bob Reganess's "Shoreleave" episode). The wooden ladders used throughout MAP24 are like 
			  the wooden ladder used in Roger Ritenour's EarthZD. Thanks to the bands
			  Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Tears for Fears whom I listened to while 
			  working on the map. Their album iconagraphy could originally be found as the Tarkus tank
			  in the plasma rifle secret in MAP24, and the Tears for Fears sun symbol used in intro screen and
			  as part of the "Gateway of Knowledge" at the end of the map in prior versions of the map. The sector-based shadow 
			  is still in the shape of the Tears for Fears logo. Didn't want to risk disrupting speedruns by altering the shadow 
			  to match the new sun emblem, so now its permanent memory of what once was. The plasma gun secret's TV is the TV
			  from Spackle's YakWorld. The bed was originally going to be a reference to a bed from Dino T. Manzella's Townhouses map, 
			  though it ended up becoming a reference to my dumb real-life avocado colored bed at the time. 
			  The small ceiling hand sector near the intro of MAP24 is based on a low-scale image of 3d_molier's cartoon hand 3d model.
			  The visual trick of the moving prisoner was inspired by a similar trick used in Hugo Elias's McFearsm.wad.
			  Thanks to Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog 3 for "Sky Santuary Zone"
			  Epic's Unreal Gold, and iD's Quake 3 which were large inspirations for the theme of MAP24. All resources in this wad prefixed 
			  with "KS_" are described individually in detail in OldResourceCredits.txt of LKTex.
