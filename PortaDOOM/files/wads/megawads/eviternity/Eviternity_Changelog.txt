                                 EVITERNITY
                               v1.0 Changelog
===========================================================================
Changes since RC1:

GENERAL
-------

    SETTINGS & HOUSEKEEPING
    -----------------------
    · By popular demand, infinite height is no longer enforced in GZDoom.
    · The pistol has been sped up and its recoil removed, making your life
      slightly easier until you pick up something better.
    · For GZDoom we added a weather toggle to the menu (go to Options, then
      "Eviternity Options" at the bottom).
    · Map title callout no longer displays on TITLEMAP.
    · Fixed death exit transitions borking up skill levels in GZDoom.
    · Added episode selections for Eternity Engine.
    · DEHACKED is now even more compatible with Doom Retro. Thanks to Brad 
      for his help!
    · Speaking of DEHACKED, there were two such lumps in RC1 and one was 
      empty, causing issues in some ports. It’s been removed.
    · Custom enemies are now shown after you beat the game in GZDoom.

    GRAPHICS & ART
    ----------------
    · Intermission map titles/backgrounds for maps 20, 24, and 26 has been
      updated.
    · There’s now some story/lore/poetry! Intermission texts have been
      added, huge thanks to Bauul for his efforts with this.
    · Map title cards for map31 and map32 were switched. Fixed this and
      also in ZMAPINFO.
    · Made text color of episode selection in gzdoom white, to match the
      rest of things.
    · Removed grey bar from top of GZDoom's loading screen.
    · Adjusted Y offset on the custom short torches so they don’t appear do
      be gliding around.
    · Changed the final frame of the astral cacodemon death so its corpse
      is lower: This makes it more obviously dead and obstructs the view
      less.
    · A new COLORMAP is used that improves software rendering.
    · Some of the skies have been adjusted to tile (or tile better)
      vertically.
    · Replaced the vanilla single rocket sprite with one that doesn’t use
      the green range—Eviternity’s change to teal stood out a little too
      much in that one.
    · There’s now a proper BOSSBACK lump after you finish the  last level,
      massive thanks to Kristus for his stunning effort with this one!

    MONSTERS
    --------
    · Astral cacodemon fire changed so center fireball isn’t doubled,
      making it slightly less lethal. Instead center projectile is a
      cacodemon fireball.
    · Annihilator (Baron replacement) had health lowered from 1400 to 1100,
      and the delay to chaingun firing increased from 16 to 20 game tics.
    · The Nightmare demon had its health lowered from 400 to 300, making it
      a little less of a bully.
    · The Archangelus (final boss) had extensive work done:
    · Entirely new set of sprites thanks to an absolutely stunning effort
      by Clay!
    · All new sounds via ukiro and Eric T.
    · Increased the HP of first phase from 9300 to 10000.
    · Increased the HP second phase from 3500 to 5000.
    · Added a new attack for Archangelus' second phase.
    · Fixed an issue that Archangelus's arch-vile attack has lesser delay
      in DECORATE.
    · Added new death effect.

LEVELS
------

    MAP01
    -----
    · Changed FLAT on top of switch in the tar pit to a black metal instead
      of the rock texture it had before.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP02
    -----
    · Massive amounts of rock texture alignment, and setting proper
      unpegging to make this possible. 
    · Backpack changed to berserk.

    MAP03
    -----
    · Fixed alignments in the tower with the chaingunner.
    · Changed exit sign to the bigger variant and lowered it so it’s more
      visible once everything is lowered.
    · Changed the light effect for the exit sign to use lines 213/261 for
      light transfers instead of height tricks.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.
    · SSG secret added.

    MAP04
    -----
    · Various cliff alignment fixes.
    · Fixed tree clipping issues outdoors in software renderers, this
      required some extra sectors and I changed one tree to a smaller one.
      There’s more that could be fixed here but it’s kinda “good enough”
      now.
    · The see-through waterfall needed some Y offset fixing on the inside.
    · Added some slight variations in bookshelf texture use in the library.
    · Altered some flags for variety.
    · Fixed stuck shotgunners.

    MAP05
    -----
    · Death exit fixed.
    · One of the side room with the 2x2 teleporters had the wrong ceiling.
    · Plenty of texture alignment on the stairs.
    · Slight variety added to the use of bookshelf textures.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP06
    -----
    · The midtex bar in the alley in from the big open arena caused an
      upper texture to look weird, fixed this.
    · Minor rock alignments.
    · A hell knight in the outdoor area is often not woken up by the
      player, so moved him a little bit. 
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP07
    -----
    · The chaingunners on the gray brick ledge somehow needed more room to
      wake up in gzdoom. This was fixed for two of them but the third stood
      in a place that didn’t let itself be rearranged as easily without
      breaking the pattern. So I deleted him, leaving only two chaingunners.
    · Aligned some texture near the red teleporter in the water.
    · Fixed Y alignment in sector 728.
    · Final room needed some upper unpegged for some linedefs in the OSPRTB
      support beams.
    · 242’ed the slight floor indent in the corridors into the exit room.
      Zzul had complained about the unevenness on his stream.
    · Sector 203 and 206 had their ceiling FLAT change to fit the texture
      better (they’re doors, so only visible when opened)

    MAP08
    -----
    · The pillars that raise towards yellow key had all their lines as
      action 123 (lift) which I removed: It was residue from an older
      version of the mechanism.
    · It was possible to raise the caco and chaingunner platforms platforms
      by the YK multiple times. Switched to voodoo solution.
    · Some slight light level tuning to appease software rendering.
    · Texture alignment stuff.

    MAP09
    -----
    · A midtexture was only applied on one side of an impassable line (but
      that could be seen from both sides), so fixed this and changed to a
      taller texture since some stairs blocked the view of the original
      low rail.
    · Minor alignment fixes.

    MAP10
    -----
    · Death exit fixed.
    · linedefs 3763, 3749 middle texture (chainlink fence) needed Y offset
      fix to close a gap.
    · Added lights around the switches for the crusher/spider mastermind
      section since a lot of people missed them in the dark. 

    MAP11
    -----
    · Exit switch changed to 3 switches due to multi key being broken in
      PrBoom+.
    · Added block monster to the outer rim of an ice stalagmite so monsters
      don’t get pushed up it. (sector 436.)
    · Massive amounts of texture alignment.
    · Monster teleporters for the ending sometimes got blocked, making 100%
      kills impossible. These are much more reliable now, everything
      teleports in eventually even if they’re blocked repeatedly.
    · Added more health in northern section.

    MAP12
    -----
    · Lots of texture alignment.
    · It was possible to get locked out via AV jump, so now the bars raise
      higher to prevent this.
    · Outside the building some trees would clip through the floor in a
      weird way, nudged them around to avoid this.
    · Made some icicle walls impassable.
    · Fixed stuck arachnotron.
    · Made switch in 'chandelier room' more noticable.
    · Hid an Arch-Vile which was visible through a wall.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP13
    -----
    · Loads of alignment fixes.
    · The bars guarding the switch that raises exit bridge had scroll
      applied to them—adjusted the voodoo setup to avoid this.
    · The flickering fire in the hall with the carpet was looking bad in
      software rendering, so brightened the fire texture to fix it.
    · Moved Line Action 219 (tag 47) from linedef 6093 to linedefs 5711,
      5677, 5713 and 5720.
    · Moved Line Action 24728 (tag 55) from deleted linedef in sector 158
      to linedefs 913, 1023, 968, 1041, 570, 1083, and 1078.
    · Raised brightness of sector 1275 to 255 and applied sector effect 8
      (light glow).
    · Made linedefs 1140 and 1138 impassable.
    · Fixed incorrectly lower unpegged walls at the SSG secret.

    MAP14
    -----
    · Fixed the bug where two Former Captains don't spawn, after the red
      keycard door is opened.
    · Fixed the glitch with ice flats, which had different behavior than
      intended in PrBoom+ source port.
    · Fixed minor visual issues, like a wall-clipping tree and a notable
      slime trail.
    · Fixed the glitch in yellow skull key area, where the monsters could
      break blocking-bars.
    · Lowered the overall difficulty of the level, especially with the
      arena encounters.

    MAP15
    -----
    · Death exit fixed.
    · Added fireplaces to western corridor.
    · Changed clock fight into a faster, slaughter-ish version.
    · Changed yellow key fight.
    · Bridge section reworked to avoid silent teleport issues.
    · Exit location made clearer.
    · Texture adjustments.
    · Added all the missing sky tags. 
    · Automap cleaned 100%.
    · Added a bit more detail.
    · Casted all the shadows.
    · Fixed all the possible HOMS.
    · Fixed all the possible soft locks.
    · Rebuilt secret megasphere fight.
    · Added stairs in the secret megasphere room so that the player doesn't
      have to walk all the way through the castle in order to land properly
      where the powerup is placed.
    · Can now be completed with 100%/100%/100%, items are no longer stuck
      in the voodoo rooms.

    MAP16
    -----
    · Texture alignment pass, minor stuff only.
    · There was some use of line texture splitting alignment trickery that
      isn't needed anymore as there are proper texture versions for those
      sizes now.
    · Some detail work for light cast from lamps.

    MAP17
    -----
    · Deleted 5 imps that were doubled, so stuck in-game.
    · Small texture alignments.

    MAP18
    -----
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.
    · Lower unpegged door tracks at the exit.

    MAP19
    -----
    · Plenty of little texture alignment fixes.
    · Softlock possible right at the start, moved some sectors to solve it.
    · Another possible softlock in sector 6511 fixed by narrowing it. 
    · Fixed a third soft lock possible when jumping out a window.
    · A wall could be clipped through, now flagged as impassable.
    · Added teleporter shortcuts on coop that become accessible from the
      start as you progress. This way killed teammates won’t have to
      backtrack for as long. 
    · Final fight got renovated so it won't break.
    · All sky transfers redone to make sure every tag is covered.
    · Some decorative wall alcoves were flagged impassable to make
      navigating less janky.
    · A lost souls trap could be avoided entirely, moved the trigger so
      they always wake up.
    · Under some conditions a floor lowering would not change its FLAT,
      this was fixed.
    · The first set of crushers by the orange lasers are a bit of a nasty
      surprise, so some armor + health added so the player can take at
      least one hit and survive.

    MAP20
    -----
    · Plenty of alignment fixes.
    · Death exit fixed.
    · Soulsphere secret marked as secret.
    · Resolved a possible soft lock by the blue armor.
    · Resolved a possible soft lock in the vats around the soulsphere.
    · Coop had a mastermind teleport in that was stuck, replaced with
      eight (!) annihilators on UV.
    · Added 3 extra rad suits for coop.

    MAP21
    -----
    · Texture alignment fixes.
    · Replaced early backpack secret with SSG for reduced 'grind'.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP22
    -----
    · Demon arena triggers are no longer skippable.
    · Lots of alignment fixes.
    · prevented Mastermind teleporter being blocked.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP23
    -----
    · Texture alignment pass. Hopefully all rising/lowering sectors still
      have their unpegging set right still.
    · Added more annihilators for coop.
    · The switch that lowers exit teleporters now also opens doors for
      backtracking (secret hunting).
    · Changed the sky.

    MAP24
    -----
    · Minor texture alignment.
    · There were two automap items, but you can only pick up one per level,
      making 100% items impossible. 
    · The soulsphere secret could not be attained in GZDoom due to how it
      handles property transfers for sectors. This was resolved so 100%
      secrets is now possible in GZDoom.

    MAP25
    -----
    · Death exit fixed.
    · Brightened slightly for better visuals in software rendering.
    · Monster count doubled on coop.
    · Minor alignments.
    · Made outside void -20% health so you die if you somehow get tossed
      out by an arch vile.
    · Changed the encounter to be harder. Also enforced 1 cyber on easy, 2
      on medium, and 3 on hard.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.

    MAP26
    -----
    · trimmed off some bleeding edges of the start teleporter pad (vanilla/
      boom flat rendering edge bleed).
    · Alignment fixes.
    · block monster lines around the big pit.
    · Coop ammo added.

    MAP27
    -----
    · Lots of texture alignment.
    · Soulsphere secret had two sectors marked as secret, and you could
      accidentally miss one. So level now has 3 secrets instead of 4.

    MAP28
    -----
    · Changed exit to three individual switches since PRBoom+ can’t
      handle triple key switches (it only works for all 6 keys).
    · This used a bunch of STARTAN2 in areas the player couldn’t see, but
      replaced it to make sure there are no issues with PNAMES lump
      shenanigans.
    · Minor alignment fixes

    MAP29
    -----
    · Texture alignment, primarily in cave section.
    · Visual changes in caves and throne room.
    · Last fight shouldn't be broken anymore.
    · Unobtainable secret megaarmor removed.
    · Nightmare Demons in the astral horde fight now spawn from the same
      place as the astral Cacodemons, nor should they fail now.
    · Megasphere secret in Tarworld now collapses when you pick it up, as
      does the staircase next to it when you hit that first switch in this
      area.

    MAP30
    -----
    · Changed 20 imps to astral cacodemons.
    · Monster teleporters fixed so nothing gets stuck.
    · Also see changes to the Archangelus in the monsters section.

    MAP31
    -----
    · Fixed door to be red key and not blue.
    · Updated exit to lead to super secret exit, so once you go to 31 you
      also get 32 automatically. (This seems to have already been the case
      but there was a regular exit line in there too.)
    · Moved an awkwardly placed torch.
    · Tiny texture alignment fixes.

    MAP32
    -----
    Overall:
        · Some extra sectors were previously marked secret by mistake,
          making 100% impossible.
        · Lots of little tweaks for all skill settings.
        · Lots of little thing placement tweaks.

    Lava room (between blue and yellow buildings):
        · Alignment pass.
        · Moved armor so you have to climb up to it instead of grabbing
          from below.
        · The megasphere was still possible to grab without triggering the
          secret to count, should hopefully be fixed once and for all.

    Red building:
        · After the Cyberdemon at the end of the serpentine bridge a
          Mancubus teleports in. I made this a bit more robust as it was
          possible to block it before.
        · Northeastern side, there’s a switch guarded by two Hell Knights
          that lowers a wall, but coming from the other direction this wall
          is lowered by a walk-over line, leaving the switch useless (and
          thus confusing). Changed this so the switch disappears once
          pressed OR line walked over.
        · Similarly, made it slightly less confusing to come from the
          north-western side (where there’s mancs) by adding a switch and
          making sure stuff opens/disappears in a more logical way.
        · Switch by the revenants on the crate platform was a bit unclear
          to some people. Teleporting in an Arch Vile to signal its
          purpose, and also because I’m an asshole who loves Arch Viles.
        · The switch that turns of the last set of lasers before you can
          raise the “lipstick” platforms wasn’t clear, so teleporting in
          some revenants to lead the player through this progression.
        · Switch that raises the “lipsticks” was toggled to start in an ON
          stage instead, as that is more consistent with the rest of the
          room.
        · Made Mancubus-guarded berserk a non secret.
        · The eastern side, outdoors: Removed the soulsphere and added
          other health bonuses instead, as there’s a megasphere secret up
          in the rocky bits and the two spheres felt too close together.

    Green building:
        · Outside this, facing the main lava lake, there were two medikits.
          Moved those to where the Mancubi are on the red building side,
          and added a third.
        · With some obscure routing it was possible to jump into the window
          with the revenants and get stuck. Now fenced off.
        · Added some barrels scattered throughout.
        · Minor monster placement tweaks.
        · In the lava “sewers” I added a bunch of former humans when the
          outer walls lower, because why not.
        · Added some stimpaks on the upper “balcony” overlooking lava and
          green tower.
        · Also on this upper balcony, made it so the imps don’t take the
          elevator down. (It was always empty up here before, since they
          always found their way to the lift.)
        · The BFG sequence had a revenant changed to an Arch Vile and added
          an Annihilator teleporting in. Also added health + armor here.
        · BFG was somehow only present on UV.
        · The easternmost switch to raise access to the green bridge was
          pressable from below.
        · Added some detail above the blue key door that leads in here, to
          better denote this as “green building” (without using the same
          light trim technique everywhere).
        · Changed megasphere secret to soulsphere and made it slightly
          harder to spot.
        · The ceiling openings on the inside got a green light trim.
        · In the room with three lowering stairs, the door to the central
          switch was moved back from the bars so you can’t open the door
          while the bars are still up.

    Pink building:
        · Tweaked difficulties a little.
        · The green armor at the top wasn’t included on all skills, now it
          is.
        · Added a couple more hell knights on coop.
        · Added a berserk and some rockets by the Mancubi on the little
          platform outside.
        · Added a little detail to the plasma rifle room.

    Orange building:
        · Switch at the bottom hexagonal room (that crushes Arch Viles) now
          starts in the off state.
        · The above mentioned switch now opens the bottom door with the SSG,
          instead of the top one doing that, more directly leading the user
          to start the Arch Vile crushers.

    Yellow building:
        · Key can no longer be grabbed through the lasers.
        · Altered Arch Vile fight to more strictly enforce doing it from
          within the “safe room”.
        · Safe room had a rocket launcher only on easy skill, changed it to
          all skills.
        · Made sure there’s 10 Arch Viles on HMP too, but added more health
          for that skill.
        · Added a secret with some health bonuses.
        · Made rock climb up from yellow area a bit less obvious.
        · When you exit towards green building area there’s an Arachnotron
          now.

    Serpentine path:
        · Sky clipping perspective possible from lava path up above switch
          is now fixed.
        · The caves leading up to here were tweaked so the plasma is now
          only available if entering from the pink building. If you come
          the other way you presumably already have the plasma from the
          orange building.
        · In the caves leading here you could make an alternate jump to
          where a revenant is; elevated that to force the intended route.
        · The revenant that is revealed when you hit the switch (to start
          the shooting switch sequence) could be reached before the switch.
          It’s now hidden entirely until you flip the switch and bring up
          the Mancubi.
        · The Cyberdemon can now walk out onto the path a little bit,
          making the fight a bit more interesting.
        · If you come from the lava path (southwest), the bars with the
          teleporting Arachnotron now lower once you’ve shot the 10
          switches, in addition to defeating the lasers in front of the
          red building entrance.

    Blue building:
        · Added a blue light trim to more clearly indicate it’s the blue
          building.
        · Fourth switch in the arms extending out, the one that makes the
          secret megasphere available, was changed from blue to white to
          signal that it’s different.
        · Moved plasma rifle and tweaked ammo balance a bit.
        · The laser switch now reveals two Revenants on UV, to make it ever
          so slightly less easy to cheese. But still kinda easy.
        · Added second Arch Vile after blue key fight (UV only).
        · If you come to this through the “back door exit” from the yellow
          building, jumping over the start area, you can now enter the blue
          building instead of facing a dead end.
        · Lowered the risk of soft lock in coop, but if a single player
          goes in and is killed by the Arch Vile before the switch is
          flipped, it’s still locked...

    Final fight:
        · Some slight tweaks to the final black rock area to lead the
          player better.
        · On the rock climb up to the black tower, the megasphere is now a
          secret (and the path to it more hidden).
        · Some people had trouble figuring out the last jump sequence, so a
          single health bonus is added as a hint.
        · Tried to guide the user to find the switch raising the platforms
          a bit easier, some had trouble understanding where to go.
        · Redesigned final fight completely. Extensively reworked the room
          too.
        · Added an elevator from the final room so you can get out at the
          end if you want to explore more, such as to find secrets. (Thanks
          for this idea, floatrand!)
