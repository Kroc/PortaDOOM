Story: A civilization was collapsed as people got into religion of 
"ignorant egoistic idiotism". Genetically modified cattle and food 
turned the people and animals to agressive zombies. But there were
few survivors. How they weren't affected? 

map31: I haven't ideas and/or the energy to implement the secret map. So I just
 put it there to who wants to check its architecture etc. with codes. I kinda 
 want all my ideas out.

Port Differences        : Mapinfo disables crouching and jumping. Doomdefs for
