[1] INTRODUCTION
----------------

After being in production for waaaay too long, here is episode 2 of
The Darkening, sadly also the last episode. There will be no third one.

Don't cut your wrists just yet though, because in episode 2 you'll get:

 + 12 single player levels, spiffy ones too
 + 12 deathmatch levels, for all types of play
 + tweaked for optimal gameplay
 + over 600 new textures
 + all new musical score

Sounds cool, eh?


[1.x Version History]

Version 1.1: * Fixed some nasty bugs: VPO in map 04, faulty 
             	 coop support, and texture mis-alignments
	     * Tweaked maps - 02, 04, 09, 12, 14
	     * Complete nodebuild and "perfect" reject
	     * New music
             
Version 1.0: * Original release 3/8/2000



---------
[2] STORY
---------

After a hard nights driving about in the galaxy, your trusted space vessel 
"Margie" runs out of fuel and you crash on some ugly planet. 

Uhm... thats it I think. 

Oh yeah; You have to kill stuff too.

(If you depserately need a storyline, go play something else or think of
one yourself.)



----------------
[3] INSTALLATION
----------------

Oooh, this is easy. Unpack the files contained in darken2.zip into your
doom2 directory (or whatever directory you want actually) and start the
game like this:

SINGLE PLAYER:
doom2.exe -file darken2.wad

DEATHMATCH:
dm.exe -file darken2.wad -warp 13

The deathmatch levels start at map13, as the least retared of you might be
able to figure out from the above example. Heh.

[5] BUGS

* The sky isn't working with MLOOK yet. You're not supposed to look up and 
  down in DOOM anyway.

* map09 overrides the savegame buffer, so don't try to save until you're well
  into that map unless you use a source port. Sorry...

[7.1 Textures]

Please do NOT extract textures from darken2.wad and do NOT create levels that
are depending on darken2.wad to run. If you want to create a level that uses
the textures from The Darkening Episode 2, use the standalone texture WAD. See
http://www.doomworld.com/darkening for more information.



[7.2 Levels]

Authors may NOT use these levels as a base to build additional levels.   

You may distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with no 
modifications. You may distribute this file in any electronic format (BBS, 
Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this textfile intact.
