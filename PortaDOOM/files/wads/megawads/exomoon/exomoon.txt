Description             : Exomoon (aka Moonblood X) is a megawad for Doom 2. The levels are a mix of the original Moonblood with early BTSX levels. It has the ruins/temple theme with some exotic natural landscapes. Scythe and Mano Laikas also are a strong influence. It has been tested on ZDoom 2.8 and PrBoom+ 2.5.1.3.

- The amazing statusbar was created by galileo31dos01. 
- New skies are from Mechadon's pack ( https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/92795-meks-box-o-skies-v2-now-with-more-skies/?tab=comments#comment-1713907 ). 
- New textures and resources are from realm667 archives. 
- There's two textures that are from Struggle, which were used on maps 15 and 19. 
- Some textures have been changed by myself, but none from scratch.

Special thanks to rehelekretep, FrancisT18, bioshockfan90, NuclearPotato for testing the early version of the wad and giving me feedback and tips! Also thanks a lot HAK3180 (full youtube playthrough!), GarrettChan, Memfis, gaspe, Firedust, Agent6 and Mazze for helping me with open beta with lots of feedback, fdas and videos!

This wad has an mp3 version of the soundtrack, which is IMO awesome and if you want something different from the MS soundfont you should download it: http://www.mediafire.com/file/c874jm3xh9qik29/exomoon-mp3.zip/file

-----------------
The wad features:
-----------------

-> 24 new levels.
-> 15~25 minutes to finish each.
-> MBF (-complevel 11) compatibility.
-> Monster attributes changes, which can de identified by the sprite changes.
-> Mod support that changes monster behavior is probably very limited.
-> No Jumping/Crouching.

----------------------
Its main design focus:
----------------------

-> Simple and clean visuals: You might find it even more basic than IWADS.
-> Low monster count: Each level has usually around 200 monsters, with one exception.
-> Non-linearity: Not as much as Moonblood though.
-> In a difficult scale of 0 to 5, I would rate Exomoon as 2.7 (Plutonia would be 2.5 and Valiant 3).
-> Small difference between the skills levels (like 15 monsters for each difficult). 
-> If you die too much on UV, please, please, select a lower difficult. HMP is a blast to play and for me it's better than UV.
-> Strict to safe ammo management. 
-> Balanced for continuous play and pistol start.
-> Expect some light plataforming.
-> This plays very differently from Moonblood, but it's not necessarily better.

Music:
------

- All songs by myself, except map 32 (which is an unreal track).
- Levels 31, 9, 12, 18, 21 are remasters from the original Moonblood wad.
- You can download the sountrack separated here: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/100917-exomoon-sountrack-midi-pack-listen-online/

Prologue:
---------

"Humanity has been finally able to reach 
a new planetary system through the tele-
portation device!

However, recent reports show that many 
Union Aerospace members have been 
missing in the successive missions 
to the foreign lands! Even now, it is 
still unknown what lies on the other
side of the teleports... 

As an emergency measure, the 
authorities activated red alert for 
further investigations, sending the 
marines for the deadly expedition!"
