Misc. Author Info       : Makes maps for Doom

Description             : Valiant is a MBF megawad for Doom II featuring 32
                          new maps spanning 5 themed episodes. Each map is
                          designed to be played from a pistol start, but
                          some effort has been made to support continuous 
                          play as well.
                          
                          Additionally, Valiant includes a number of new
                          monsters and weapons implemented through an 
                          extensive MBF format DeHackEd patch.  As a 
                          result, Valiant is not compatible with gameplay 
                          mods, and can only be played in ports with full 
                          MBF DeHackEd support.  At present, these include 
                          ZDoom, GZDoom, PrBoom-plus (complevel 11), and 
                          Eternity.  Zandronum is also supported through 
                          DECORATE.

===========================================================================

Port Differences        : In ZDoom and Eternity, each episode is selected
                          from the main menu.  In PrBoom-plus, Valiant 
                          plays like a conventional 32 level megawad with a
                          death exit at the end of each episode.
                          
                          Episode ending texts and splash screens are
                          implemented using MAPINFO and therefore are only
                          present in (G)ZDoom, Eternity, and Zandronum.
                          
                          Music changer objects are used a few times. These
                          are not supported by Eternity, and thus Eternity
                          will simply continue playing the map's default 
                          midi track in these situations.
                          
                          The final boss will graphically glitch in ports
                          without DECORATE support but this does not impact
                          gameplay.
                          
                          I recommend playing in ZDoom or Eternity for the 
                          optimal experience.  If you would like to record 
                          demos or play multiplayer, PrBoom-plus or 
                          Zandronum are recommended, respectively.
