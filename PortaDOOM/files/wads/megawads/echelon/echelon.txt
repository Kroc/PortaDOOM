Release date            : November 28th - 2016
Author                  : Sverre Andre Kvernmo, aka Soundblock. Msg me on Doomworld if you
			  have feedback, or post in the WADs & mods thread for Echelon:

Description             : A 30-map mega wad. Yes! Finally made one... The project's chief
			  goal was to create a full set of bite-sized maps. Some maps
			  grew a little larger. A reimagining of the Doom II storyline.
Additional credits to   : Noisyvelvet, for breathing life into the monsters.
			  Fonze, for playing the beta and giving invaluable feedback.
			  Xaser, for rescuing the wad for posterity (fixed ZDoom crash bug)
			  Doomworld.com in general, Echelon post contributors in
			  particular.
Texture resource credits: About half the featured textures were done by me for this
			  project but I also lifted a lot from "Community Chest 4" and
			  "The Afterglow Collection";
			  www.doomworld.com/afterglow/textures.shtml
			  Some textures used from the "Crucified Dreams" project.
			  "Eternal Doom" material also used, some of which I created my
			  self. More complete texture credits at the end of the doc.

Other files required    : doom2.wad, zdoom.exe

* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM2
Map #                   : MAP01-MAP30
Single Player           : designed for
Cooperative 2-8 Player  : not tested, but 4 starts have been placed in each map.
Deathmatch 2-8 Player   : not designed or tested for this, but startpoints have been
			  placed.
Difficulty Settings     : Skill 1 - (Hey Not Too Rough) Early BFG/SSG. Fewer and weaker
			  monsters.
			  Skill 2 - (Hurt Me Plenty) BFG and SSG featured. More ammo and
			  items.
		          Skill 3 - (Ultra Violence) No BFG and very late SSG. Designed
			  around this skill, for that original Doom feeling. Pistol starts
			  from here might be the most challenging way to play this wad,
			  beyond...
			  Skill 4 - (Nightmare) not tested.
Play Notes              : Feel free to use jump and duck if you so please, but these new
			  functions aren't neccessary to finish the maps. Some shortcuts
			  may be obtained this way.
			  This wad is deemed complete and is not in beta, but any bug
			  reports of note will likely spur an update. I don't predict
			  very many changes at this point.

* Construction *

Base                    : New verteces, linedefs and sectors from scratch. 3 originally
			  sprited monsters. Bunches of both new and reused textures.
Build Time              : Started life as Project PAR, back in 2013. Morphed into Echelon.
			  Portions of the wad's architecture date back as far as 1996.
			  I.e. Map 12 started life as a reject for Eternal Doom MAP 01
			  and MAP 29 was embarked upon in late 1998. Pieces of map
			  throughout also contain some older stuff.
Editor(s) used          : GZDoomBuilder
			  SLADE v3.0.2
			  Photoshop Elements
Known Bugs              : There are some "slime" artifacts along the way, here and there.
May Not Run With...     : Other Doom source ports than ZDOOM. Maps 28 & 29 are high detail
			  and may not run well on slower PCs.


* Copyright / Permissions *

No strings. Author condones maps and original textures (lump category "PAR") for this
project to be distributed (and modified, if need be). The remainder is up to the 
respective authors, but AFAIK they've let me use it freely, so go ahead.
