Misc. Author Info       : 22 year old Doomer (Erik), A somewhat younger Doomer (Torn)

Description             : A 32 level megawad for doom2. This megawad doesn't have perfect 
		          texture alignment, insane detail and fantasticly hard gameplay.
			  Instead it focuses on small fun maps to blast through without much
 			  thought about defense. The difficulty rises steadily as you go through
			  the maps and the last few should challenge even the best.

Additional Credits to   : id software, Fredrik Johansson (textures), ZarcyB (titlepic)
			  Chris "Ryback" Ratcliff (map30 idea). Drew "stx-Vile" Dewore (testing)
			  All other testers too, thanks!

For veteran doomers, I suggest playing e1 and e2 on uv -fast and e3 on uv if you want
a good challenge. You will get stripped of all weapons every 10 maps anyway so it's 
doesn't matter if you quit and use -warp 21 to get to ep3 for example.

For good doomers (like the most of you out there I guess), I suggest playing the whole
thing on skill 4 (ultra violence). It will get hard towards the end.

For average, casual doomers, I suggest playing e1 and e2 on uv and e3 on hmp.

For newbies (like there are any) and weak players, I suggest playing e1 and e2
on hmp and e3 on hntr (skill 2).
