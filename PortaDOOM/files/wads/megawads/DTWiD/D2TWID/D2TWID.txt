Description             : Doom II The Way id Did is the long awaited sequel
                          to 2011's Doom The Way id Did. It comprises 32
                          levels that endeavour to both look and play as
                          though they've come from Dallas, 1994, from the
                          very toiling hands of Sandy, John and American.

                          The idea was originally kicked about by Jason
                          Root aka Hellbent, whose passion for the game
                          and knack for growing enthusiasm resulted in one
                          of the most successful community collaborations
                          in Doomworld history – not to mention an
                          impressive collection of more than 100 total
                          submissions. While not quite as successful as
                          the first project in this regard, painstaking
                          engths have been made by those involved to ensure
                          that D2TWiD is as true a doppelganger of id's
                          Doom 2 as it could ever be. And we hope that
                          you agree! Enjoy!
