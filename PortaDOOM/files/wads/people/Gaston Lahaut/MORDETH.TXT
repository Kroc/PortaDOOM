*Installation*

Download the archive MORDETH.ZIP. Make a subdirectory within your Doom2
directory (eg "C:\DOOM2\MORDETH") and unzip the files in there. Then, put
the file 'mordeth.bat' into your doom2 directory (eg "C:\DOOM2") and start
by typing 'mordeth' at the DOS doom2 prompt. First time players will be
confronted with an installation batch file, which will make a functional
Mordeth game by extracting sprites&flats to a Mordeth WAD file, and by
making an alternative .exe file. Installation is required to play Mordeth.
Installation of Mordeth will never comprise or even *touch* your original
Doom2 game. This installation only has to be done once, after which you can
play Mordeth indefinetely. More info on installation in the README.TXT.

* Level Descriptions *

Find your way through infernal forts and take the fight to Hell, again.
Battle your way through ancient cities, with fog swirling in dark streets
illuminated by gaslights. Enter the foggy swamps, filled with rotting trees
and the eerie cries of the Wyverns... Solve the puzzles, enjoy the great
playability, admire the new monsters, fight the Boss Swamp Dragons in the
last level... Yeah, you're going to *love* Mordeth..!
