Misc. Author Info       : Sported a full 10 fingers at the last count.
			  Go see the homepage for more essential info.

Description             : Sweet level with bricks and corroded metal as its
                          main texture theme. Some wood and marble too. 
			  I've pushed the engine to its very limit in just
			  about every damn area - enormous level of detail.
			  A LOT harder on UV than the first version, but
                          lower skills should suit mortal players fine.
                          The level is now highly non-linear. Woohoo.

			  There's no silly plot, just kill stuff.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch with inspiration from 
                          several different pwads and other games.

Build time		: Some 250 hours I guess. Hard to estimate though.
			  A lot of that time was learning and just running
                          around in the level. Most areas have been rebuilt
                          about 3 times, some as much as 7, before I was
                          satisfied.

editor(s) used          : In the beginning I used DoomEd v2.60 beta 4 but
                          as soon as I got EdMap 1.20 I used that one.
                          IDBSP 1.0 was also used. (Better than 1.0.1)
                          When the level got bigger than 150K IDBSP crashed
                          and I had to use WARM (another bsp), but it did
                          something strange - the map disappeared! (Not the
                          level - the map you get when you press TAB.)
			  Got rid of it using BSP.

			  For the new version I used EdMap 1.40, EdMap 1.31, 
			  WinDEU 5.24 and BSP 2.4 beta.

                          Jim Flynn applied some magic with DETH 3.92.

Known Bugs              : Pffft, silly.
