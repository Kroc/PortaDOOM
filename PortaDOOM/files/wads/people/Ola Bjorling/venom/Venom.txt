Misc. Developer Info    : 19 years old (born 1979), from Sweden,
                          heavily into techno music and computer graphics.
                          No new graphics in this WAD though.
Description             : Quite similar to the theme of most Ultimate DOOM
                          E4 levels. As always loads of cool lighting,
                          traps and state-of-the-art architecture.
                          This is my finest piece of DOOM level art to date,
                          without a doubt.
                          HOWEVER, this is a linear level. Sorry all lovers
                          of non-linear maps out there, but you might just
                          enjoy it anyway.
                          This is a HARD level. Hard and big. You'll
                          probably want to save quite a lot, and this
                          is the kind of level you only play once I think.
                          A bit like the Eternal levels, but perhaps not
                          quite as enormous. VERY detailed though.

                          If anyone want to help testing ammo balance

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : On and off for about a year :-)
                          I'd guess 200-300 hours or something, including
                          playtesting.
Editor(s) used          : EdMap 1.40  <- I just love it
                          EdMap 1.31  <- Uses less memory, enabled me to
                                         build this huge fucker. Used for
                                         the last 15% of the level.
                          WARM 1.6    <- started with this one
                          BSP 2.2     <- used during 70% of the time
                          BSP 2.3     <- used for final build
Known Bugs              : I was able to produce a visplane overflow once,
                          but I guess I fixed it somehow.
                          There are a few misaligned textures too,
                          but I'm too lazy to fix it :-)
                          Otherwise no bugs. Please report any you can find.
