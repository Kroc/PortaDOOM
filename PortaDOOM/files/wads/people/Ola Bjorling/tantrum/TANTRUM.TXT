Misc. Author Info       : DOOM II addict, perfectionist (see the level...)
                          17 years old (young) , from Krokom, near ™stersund
                          in Sweden. Proud of his level. :-)

Description             : Lots of different brick walls and corrosed metal.
                          (Excuse my english, I think it's called corrosed,
                          what I mean is metal with corrosion.)
                          Dark, (not TOO dark) sunset-like feeling. Lots of 
                          brilliant light shadings. Clever setup, very good 
                          looking and fun to play. 
                          There's no story, just go out there and kick some 
                          daemon butt!

Additional Credits to   : Jeff Rabenhurst for the brilliant EdMap 1.40 id for 
                          making that game, what's it called... :) 
                          I think this level is at least as good as any other 
                          I have ever played, even though this is only my 
                          second release level.
                          Lots of inspiration from Andre Sverre Kvernmo,
                          one of the "The Master Levels" authors. His level
                          "The Image Of Evil" is an incredible piece of art,
                          but not much fun to play...

                          I also got some inspiration from the Quake Screen-
                          shots.
                          
                          Jeff, please make EdMap able to deal with maps
                          bigger than 150K! It keeps hanging up! (Even though
                          I have 629K free!)

Episode and Level #     : MAP 01
Single Player           : Yes that was my original intention.
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes, could be fun. A few places perfect for coop.
                          NOT TESTED!!!!
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes, the starting points are there, but for you who 
                          like to blast someone every 3 seconds, this level
                          is a bit big. NOT TESTED!!!!
Difficulty Settings     : Yes, UV only for people with a deathwish. 
New Sounds              : No. Tantrum is just pure ass-kicking level!
New Graphics            : No. id did a great job. 
New Music               : No, but IDMUS16 gives moody music.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch with inspiration from 
                          several different pwads. (And my own sick mind...)

Editor(s) used          : In the beginning I used DoomEd v2.60 beta 4 but
                          as soon as I got EdMap 1.20 I used that one.
                          IDBSP 1.0 was also used. (Better that 1.0.1)
                          When the level got bigger than 150K IDBSP crashed
                          and I had to use WARM (another bsp), but it did
                          something strange - the map disappeared! (Not the
                          level - the map you get when you press TAB.)
                          (Fixed that now, but I don't know how I did it.=)

Known Bugs              : Perhaps there are a few cosmetic errors etc, but
                          I've playtested it a *LOT* and couldn't find 
                          anything that could be called a bug. Runs a bit slow
                          in the bloodfalls room on full screen on my DX4 100
                          but that is due to over 200 2S lines in sight, 
                          nothing else. (Well, the overall map size has an
                          effect on the speed, but not that much. WARM is 
                          a bsp that gives really fast levels.)
