General Description     : My Boss level replacement for e1m8...22 years later

After exiting the Computer Station you knew the worst was up ahead. You still hadn't
reached the place where the demons were coming from. The steel door shuts
behind you as you realize you're there; you're at the Phobos Anomaly. Cracks from
hell are all over the place as seepage from the portal invades the entire installation.
Now it's time to find the portal and stop the demons from coming through. You know
UAC had hundreds of scientists working at a high-tech lab somewhere in this area, and
the portal must be connected to it somehow. Time to lock and load.
