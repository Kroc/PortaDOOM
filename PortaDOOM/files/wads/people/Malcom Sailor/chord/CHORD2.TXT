                          I would greatly appreciate feedback on:

			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.
			  SO SEND ME MAIL

			  Levels by me: (ones marked with a * not worth
                          checking out)

                          Hayduke1
			  
			  Soon to come:
				Some stuff in Gothic2
                                Chord: the next generation (corny name...)
                          For Quake:
                                More Hayduke's
                                A dm level pack with Matt, hopefully.

Description             : MAP26
			  Large quasi-castle, very detailed, definitely one of
                          my better levels, (Ola would disagree:() I spent
                          ages on this one. It is longer than I would've liked
                          though:(

			  I would _not_ recommend UV for the "average player"
			  UV is for very good players, much harder than doom2.
			  (For one thing there aren't unnecessary
                          invulnerabilitys everywhere...)

			  Has very cool lighting and a ton of monsters...
			  Enjoy!

BEST WHEN PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM ITS PREQUEL!

                          Also thanks to those who tested this wad... I
                          definitely got some good criticism that made this
                          wad better.
