Misc. Author Info       : Member of the Black Star Coven. We Design
			  Good Levels...
			  We also like to play good levels, so if your stuff
			  is good, mail me... 
			  If you think your stuff is good enough, mail John
			  Bye at jb54@le.ac.uk. You may get accepted for
			  membership. Note: we need QuakeC and Texture Artists

			  I would greatly appreciate feedback on:
			  ammo/health: there's more than I need but I know
			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.
			  SO SEND ME MAIL

			  I used to put a long list of all the wads I ever made
			  Including a description, but that got awfully long so
			  I'm just going to describe my newer (and better)
			  ones.
			  Bad Stuff (by my standards, these are still better than 
			  alot):
			  darker.zip
			  3_pack1.zip(Contains three levels, obviously).
			  ds-61-3.zip(Contains seven levels.) 
			  Skull.zip
			  Good stuff:
			  quikisgd.zip and quikisg2.zip; Short kick ass wads.
			  Nosun*.zip; Some of my best ever. Two long, one mid,
			  and one short -length levels out so far. Get 'em now!
			  Shrthard.zip; should be out by now; short real hard 
			  kick ass wads.
			  >dk.zip: dk.wad, a high quality fortress level<
			  !This last zip was postponed. I get an error about
			  an unknown thing class before the level starts.
			  According to Dck, there are no unknown things.
			  If anyone knows how to solve this problem, Help
			  is _Much_ appreciated.
			  
			  Soon to come:
			  Work in The Black Star Covens The Talosian Incident
			  Web Page: Http://www.geocities.com/timesquare/8666/bscoven.html
			  (Doubtful) Other Nosuns
			  Sequel to this.
			  Probably some other stuff.

					THE BEST WADS:
					Darkcvnt.wad. By keith phipps (I think thats his name)
					Cabal*.wad By Sverre Kvernmo


Description             : MAP25
			  Hooee is this one hard. Start out in a room with                          
			  yer pistol and a berserk up against two revenants...
			  and thats just the beginning<G>

			  I would _not_ recommend UV for the "average player"
			  UV is for very good players, much harder than doom2.
			  (For one thing there aren't unnecessary invulnerabilitys
			  everywhere...)

			  Okay, so you want to know what this one looks like.
			  I guess it could be a satanic mansion of some sort,
			  I dunno, but it uses the Pan* textures a lot and
			  has wicked lighting (at least according to testers)

Additional Credits to   : Patrick Martin for testing and constructive criticism.
			  Check out his "Blakgate.wad"
			  It kicks ass.

			  Ben Morris for dck3.61
			  It kicks ass! I designed two maps in one week that
			  together total over 500 sectors, all thanks to his
			  editor.

			  All the good wads I ever played for giving me inspiration.
			  (Especially those mentioned above.)

			  John Bye for boosting my ego a little and letting
			  me into the Black Star Coven. Check out the
			  homepage at the top (or close). Mail john and become
			  a beta tester and you get to play a bunch of mine and
			  Many other Top-Quality wad designers before anyone else.
			  Also, play johns cygnusiv.zip.
			  He's at jb54@le.ac.uk

			  Sverre Andre Kvernmo for designing the best levels
			  ever (cabal and others, some in the master levels).
			  He's also a pretty cool guy.
			  "Eternal Doom II just ain't the same without him."
			  Be sure to mail him (if you play his levels) and tell him
			  how good a level designer he is.

			  My dad for fixing (and breaking) the computer.
			  And testing my levels on skill 3.

			  Whoever made Zennode.

			  And a big Thank-You-Very-Fucking-Much to anyone who
			  emailed me and told me my wads kick ass (actually,
			  no ones ever mailed me to tell me other wise, so
			  play this wad and agree and mail me.)
			  It pisses me off to see all those mid-quality wads
			  (which will remain nameless, except for Raven.wad.
			  Dumb Fucker's now at Id, and his stuff is _UGH_).
			  get so much attention cause of their distribution.
			  Me and a million others, such as Patrick Martin or
			  Michael Krause or others (These guys get mentioned
			  cause they're cool) are much better level designers...
			  Oh well..,

			  Also thanks to those who tested this wad... I definitely
			  got some good criticism that made this wad better.

PS: IF YOU STILL USE THE KEYBOARD; MAKE THE SWITCH (I RECENTLY DID).
YOU'LL KICK ASS TWICE AS MUCH AS BEFORE!
(This is non-critical of you keyboarders, though... I always hated cocky
mousers when I was a keyboarder...)
