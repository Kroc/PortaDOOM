Misc. Author Info       : Previous levels have earned me acclaim.
                          9th on the Doomworld top ten of level editing.
                          Many many other levels out, the only good ones are
                          the other levels in this series (chord1, chord2,
                          chord_ng and chordg... if anyone's wondering where
                          the chord name came from... so am I!)

                          This will almost definitely be my last map ever.
                          Please drop me a line with your opinions of this or
                          any of my other maps before I drop out of the doom
                          community forever. (Though has anyone noticed, the
                          chord series now extends from map25 to map 29...
                          all thats left is the finale!)
            			
Description             : MAP27
                          It took way too long to make. Detailed, dificult,
                          you know the drill... just download it and play it,
                          trust me.
                          It requires a source port (any source port that
                          removes VPO and HOM, ie. almost any source
                          port) to run, though jumping etc. is cheating.

MEANT TO BE PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM ITS PREQUELS/SEQUELS!

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : MAP27
Single Player           : Yes, built for it. 
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : sure, but not tested.
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Special deathmatch arena included! Try it out with
                          all your friends!!! I'm looking for someone to run
                          a csdoom server of this.
Difficulty Settings     : Yes. UV is _not_ for the average player.
                          I make my levels as hard as I personally enjoy
                          playing them, but I spend just as much time tweaking
                          the easier skill levels so lesser players can still
                          enjoy. If skill 4 is too hard for you, its very
                          easy to switch to an easier skill level. (Do you
                          detect a hint of annoyment in my voice???)
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : From scratch.
Build Time              : A long, long time.
Editor(s) used          : Dck 3.62 By Ben Morris
Nodebuilders            : Bsp 5.0 By Lee Killough and Colin Phipps
                          RMB 2.1 By Jens Hykkelbjerg
Known Bugs              : There are a few occasional errors in monster
                          behaviour, but these are bugs in the source ports
                          and not in my level. It took me a lot of effort and
                          annoyance to finally figure that out. (Ie. Cacos
                          getting stuck on top of each other and monsters
                          falling off tall ledges, hopefully someday this
                          stuff will get fixed!)
