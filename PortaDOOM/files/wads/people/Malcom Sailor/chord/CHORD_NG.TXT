Description             : MAP28
			  A level with (as always) vicious gameplay. SInce
			  I've been doing a lot of Quake lately I tried to
			  add in a lot of cool architecture on the roof and
			  stuff... nothing compared to my Quake levels but
			  relative to the average doom level the architecture
			  is pretty good. I like the look: metal2/brown96
			  /teklite texturing scheme, a large tower/building
			  which somehow survived the apocalypse.

			  I would _not_ recommend UV for the "average player"
			  UV is for very good players, much harder than doom2.
			  (For one thing there aren't unnecessary
			  invulnerabilitys everywhere...)

			  Has very cool lighting/architecture and a ton of 
			  monsters...
			  Enjoy!

BEST WHEN PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM ITS PREQUEL(s)!

Base                    : An alienated and psychopathic weirdo.
Build Time              : A week, prolly 10-20 hours, I was working on other
