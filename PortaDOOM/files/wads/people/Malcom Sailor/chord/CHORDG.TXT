Description             : MAP29
			  Dark underground marble/rock thing covered in vines
			  with detailed lighting, balanced and ridiculously
			  dificult gameplay (most people will want to play on
			  skill 3). One of my best maps, I'd have to say. You
			  can judge for yourself.

			  There is a miniscule HOM by the yellow key... if
			  anyone knows what causes it, mail me.

			  I'd really appreciate any feedback. Please!
							     
BEST WHEN PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM ITS PREQUEL(s)!

			  development.
			  Patrick Martin and Cocoon for playtesting.
			  Eric james roberts for offering to feature it on his
			  page.
			  All the good authors for giving me
			  inspiration.

			  Lee Killough for BSP.
			  Also thanks to those who tested this wad.

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : MAP29
Single Player           : Yes, built for it. 
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : sure, but not tested.
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : No... 
			  If you wanna have an awesome DM check out +Gothic+
			  Dm (2) ...
Difficulty Settings     : Yes. UV is _not_ for the average player. If you play
			  this skill, expect to get your ass whupped. It is
			  meant to be an extreme challenge. Most people will
			  probably want to play Skill 3 which is meant to
			  equal doom2 on UV, and skill 2
			  is doom2 on HMP.
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No.
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : An alienated and psychopathic weirdo.
Build Time              : No idea whatsoever.
Editor(s) used          : Dck 3.62, by far the very best editor. Try it, it 
			  kicks deu's (and all the others) ass. Read the docs.  
Nodebuilders            : Zennode 0.92, BSP 2.2
Known Bugs              : Possibly, if you find any, email me, please!
