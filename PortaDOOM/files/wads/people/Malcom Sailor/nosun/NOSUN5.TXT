			  I would greatly appreciate feedback on:
			  ammo/health: there's more than I need but I know
			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.

			  .zips I have made:
			  darker.zip: contains darker.wad, my first level
			  3_pack1.zip: contains ruler.wad, omelet.wad
			  and tekrkbrn.wad, better than most stuff
			  out there but nothing special
			  ds-61-2.zip: contains seven high-quality maps
			  alapolgy.wad: two very short levels
			  fromdrem.wad: a very short level from a dream
			  lab.wad: a high-tech lab
			  boom.wad: a ghost-town. The first room is
			  practically copied right out of dante's gate.
			  It's good though.
			  wasteme.wad: an untested (at point of release)
			  wad. I left out the exit switch (blush).
			  sinferno.wad: a okay hell wad.
			  quikisgd.zip: one of my more recent releases.
			  Short, high quality, and action packed.
		-...good, high quality level. Reminds me of e4m1
		-cmarti39@icon.net
			  quikisg2.zip: Sequel to quikisgd
			  -Definitely got the adrenaline going
				-Eric Luke
			  Skull.zip: skull.wad for doom 1
			  DS-61-3.zip: update of ds-61-2.zip
			  nosun.zip: first of this series. Kicks ass
			  -I love it sooooooooooooooooo
				-Michael Krause
			  nosun2.zip: second of this series: the space ship at
			  the end of nosun (oh, so that's what it was)
			  nosun3.zip: wad of the day at Macdoom 
			  -I'm sorry but this level is just to cool. superb
				- Elf66
			  >dk.zip: dk.wad, a high quality fortress level<
			  !This last zip was postponed. I get an error about
			  an unknown thing class before the level starts.
			  According to Dck, there are no unknown things.
			  If anyone knows how to solve this problem, Help
			  is _Much_ appreciated.
			  
			  Soon to come:
			  Work in The Black Star Covens The Talosian Incident
			  Web Page: Http://www.geocities.com/timesquare/8666/bscoven.html
			  (Maybe) Other Nosuns
			  Probably some other stuff.
			  QUAKE!

					THE BEST WADS:
					Darkcvnt.wad. By keith phipps
					Cabal*.wad By Sverre Kvernmo

MEANT TO BE PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM NOSUN 1-4!!!!!

Description             : This is the fourth of a series of .wads I am making.
			  I'm going to divide this into two parts:

Story                   : This is an underground passage to your ride home, and
			  will probably be the last level I make in this series
			  If enough people demand more, I may make a quickie where
			  you kill your bosses back on earth...

Layout                  : Medium size level.
			  Completely _Beautiful_ .wad... I think it may be my
			  best looking yet. Its also a very fun wad... the only
			  problem is that its sort of linear, but in this wad
			  you hardly notice.
			  Jump into the cockpit to exit.

Additional Credits to   : Patrick Martin for testing and constructive criticism.
			  Check out his "Blakgate.wad"
			  It kicks ass.

			  Ben Morris for dck3.61
			  It kicks ass! I designed two maps in one week that
			  together total over 500 sectors, all thanks to his
			  editor.

			  All the good wads I ever played for giving me inspiration.
			  (Especially those mentioned above.)

			  John Bye for boosting my ego a little and letting
			  me into the Black Star Coven. Check out the
			  homepage at the top (or close). Mail john and become
			  a beta tester and you get to play a bunch of mine and
			  Many other Top-Quality wad designers before anyone else.
			  Also, play johns cygnusiv.zip.

			  Sverre Andre Kvernmo for designing the best levels
			  ever (cabal and others, some in the master levels).
			  He's also a pretty cool guy.
			  "Eternal Doom II just ain't the same without him."

			  My dad for fixing (and breaking) the computer.
			  And testing my levels on skill 3.

			  Anyone who tested this wad...

			  Whoever made Zennode.
