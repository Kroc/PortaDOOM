			  I would greatly appreciate feedback on:
			  ammo/health: there's more than I need but I know
			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.

			  .zips I have made:
			  darker.zip: contains darker.wad, my first level
			  3_pack1.zip: contains ruler.wad, omelet.wad
			  and tekrkbrn.wad, better than most stuff
			  out there but nothing special
			  ds-61-2.zip: contains seven high-quality maps
			  alapolgy.wad: two very short levels
			  fromdrem.wad: a very short level from a dream
			  lab.wad: a high-tech lab
			  boom.wad: a ghost-town. The first room is
			  practically copied right out of dante's gate.
			  It's good though.
			  wasteme.wad: an untested (at point of release)
			  wad. I left out the exit switch (blush).
			  sinferno.wad: a okay hell wad.
			  quikisgd.zip: one of my more recent releases.
			  Short, high quality, and action packed.
		-...good, high quality level. Reminds me of e4m1
		-cmarti39@icon.net
			  Skull.zip: skull.wad for doom 1
			  DS-61-3.zip: update of ds-61-2.zip
			  nosun.zip: first of this series. Kicks ass
			  nosun2.zip: second of this series: the space ship at
			  the end of nosun (oh, so that's what it was)
			  dk.zip: dk.wad, a high quality fortress level
			  
			  Soon to come:
			  Work in The Black Star Covens The Talosian Incident
			  Web Page: Http://www.geocities.com/timesquare/8666/bscoven.html

					THE BEST WADS:
					Darkcvnt.wad.
					Cabal*.wad

MEANT TO BE PLAYED SEPERATELY FROM NOSUN AND NOSUN2!!!!!

Description             : This is the third of a series of .wads I am making.
			  I'm going to divide this into two parts:

Story                   : well, yer off the spaceship. You better find a way
			  to get home. If you ever make it out of this city
		       
Layout                  : Large level. 500 plus sectors.
			  Its an underground alien city.
			  Good lighting. Good alignment. My friend and play-
			  tester said there were some HOM's, but I don't see
			  any. If you do, tell me where.

Additional Credits to   : Patrick Martin for testing and constructive criticism.
			  Check out his "Blakgate.wad"
			  It kicks ass.

			  Ben Morris for dck3.61
			  It kicks ass! I designed two maps this week that
			  together total over 500 sectors, all thanks to his
			  editor.

			  All the good wads I ever played for giving me inspiration.
			  (Especially those mentioned above.)

			  John Bye for boosting my ego a little and letting
			  me into the Black Star Coven.

			  Sverre Andre Kvernmo for designing the best levels
			  ever (cabal and others, some in the master levels).

			  Whoever made Zennode.
