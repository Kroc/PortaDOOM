Misc. Author Info       : Member of the Black Star Coven. We Design
			  Good Levels...
			  We also like to play good levels, so if your stuff
			  is good, mail me...  You may even get accepted for
			  membership.., who knows? Its not my call, though.

			  I would greatly appreciate feedback on:
			  ammo/health: there's more than I need but I know
			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.
			  SO SEND ME MAIL

			  I used to put a long list of all the wads I ever made
			  Including a description, but that got awfully long so
			  I'm just going to describe my newer (and better)
			  ones.
			  Bad Stuff (by my standards, these are still better than 
			  alot):
			  darker.zip
			  3_pack1.zip(Contains three levels, obviously).
			  ds-61-3.zip(Contains seven levels.) 
			  Skull.zip
			  Good stuff:
			  quikisgd.zip and quikisg2.zip; Short kick ass wads.
			  Nosun*.zip; Some of my best ever. Two long, one mid,
			  and one short -length levels out so far. Get 'em now!
			  Shrthard.zip; should be out by now; short real hard kick ass
			  wads.
			  >dk.zip: dk.wad, a high quality fortress level<
			  !This last zip was postponed. I get an error about
			  an unknown thing class before the level starts.
			  According to Dck, there are no unknown things.
			  If anyone knows how to solve this problem, Help
			  is _Much_ appreciated.
			  
			  Soon to come:
			  Work in The Black Star Covens The Talosian Incident
			  Web Page: Http://www.geocities.com/timesquare/8666/bscoven.html
			  (Maybe) Other Nosuns
			  QUAKE!!!!
			  Probably some other stuff.

					THE BEST DOOM2 WADS:
					Darkcvnt.wad. By keith phipps (I think thats his name)
					Cabal*.wad By Sverre Kvernmo


Description             : This is the first of a series of .wads I am making.
			  I'm going to divide this into three parts:

Changes since last version: Not much by the way of monsters. Mainly I got rid of
			  all the textures that I didn't feel fit, especially
			  the bronze textures... if you liked it better the old
			  way, mail me and I'll upload a zip with both for
			  people to compare.

Story                   : 2090: some research station orbiting earth.
			  "Um, professer," says a slave.
			  "What," snarls a half-man half-ape that couldn't
			  have passed grade school.
			  "The heat on earth is gradually decreasing. Less
			  light is coming this way each day. It appears
			  the sun is going out."
			  "That's impossible!" The professer kicks the slave.
			  "Look for yourself!" Says the slave a little to
			  quickly.
			  "You know I can't read!" The slave recieves another
			  kick.
			  Another slave somewhere down the corridor rolls
			  his eyes. The professer may have noticed yet is
			  already shouting into his comlink to get someone
			  "reputable" who _can_ read.

			  The nextday, same place.
			  "Welcome, Doctor appleberry." Says the apeman.
			  What a stupid name, thinks the slave, whose name
			  was recently changed to "shithead" by the professer.
			  "Read this," says shithead.
			  "Yes, he's right."

			  Several weeks later, you, a prisoner of war, get 
			  called in your cell somewhere in one of the less 
			  habitible places on earth. (Pollution has destroyed
			  nearly half the landcovered portion of the world,
			  with North America a cesspool of burning waste. The
			  ozone layer is so thin, 3 weeks of exposure
			  throughout your life would kill you.)
			  "You're going on a mission, you worthless piece of
			  shit. You better not fail me this time. Three strikes
			  and you're out."
			  You remember failing your first two impossible
			  missions and barely escaping with your life.
			  "Go to room 3a960236548079b.5 for briefing at 3:00"
			  (97% of earths population is now in prison.)

			  At 3:00 you wander down the long hall way towards
			  the room . "3a960236548079b.44, .46, .48, here we
			  are." You say to yourself. One stray step and you
			  would be toast: the walls are adorned with automatic
			  plasma cannons and other weapons trained on your
			  every move. You sigh and enter the room.
			  "Hello, sit down."
			  "Enough pleasantries. What mission have you got to
			  kill me off this time?"
			  "A mission to the sun. A few weeks ago we found out
			  that the sun is giving off less and less heat so
			  through the wonders of modern technology we sent
			  some spies in" says the hitler lookalike. "They
			  found some sort of alien space station that was
			  somehow poisoning our sun. Once it burns out they
			  know there will be no resistence from us, and they
			  can take our solar systems resources for free."
			  "Wait a minute," you say. "I know we can get to the
			  sun, and build materials strong enough to resist 
			  its heat, but its gravity's too strong. How did
			  you get this information. You can't even transmit
			  off it, let alone fly a ship off."
			  "Yes, but the aliens have much more advanced tech-
			  nology than us. They snuck on a saucer headed away
			  from us, and transmitted something off the ship.
			  Yet the aliens found them immediately thereafter
			  and, we believe, killed them.
			  "Your ship will be on automatic pilot until you are
			  too close to get away from the sun. There you will 
			  get on a saucer headed for their home planet. Then 
			  you will destroy their society from the inside out."
			  "WHAT! YOU'RE CRAZY!" you shout.
			  "We can kill you right here if you'd prefer."

		       
Layout                  : Large level. You start in some smaller hallways of
			  the space station, find the blue and red keys and
			  then jump out into a huge hallway where an old
			  service train used to run. you follow its path over
			  to some computer terminals. Then out to the surface
			  of the sun (YES, I know it wouldn't have walls but
			  how else was I supposed to do it.)
	 |                You get the yellow key and back to the beginning
   |\    |    /           where you exit the space station and into a docking
   |  \  |  /             bay where you get on a ship.
   |    \|/               I made special effort to make this a level with a
   |    /|\               view. By that I mean not only great textures where
   |  /  |  \             you are but also views into cool rooms that you can't
   |/    |    \           get to (in most cases).
	 |                There are four secrets: two are hidden doors and two
			  must be run to (over ledges etc.) One is only visible
			  on the map (not marked), one contains an automap.
			  And oh, yes, those marbfac4 posts at the beginning
			  (for those of you who aren't level designers, the 
			  faces with horns on them) are switches.
			  Anywhere outside hurts, whether you're in lava or
			  not. Get a suit or an invulnerability before you go
			  outside.




Additional Credits to   : Patrick Martin for testing and constructive criticism.
			  Check out his "Blakgate.wad"
			  It kicks ass.

			  Ben Morris for dck3.61
			  It kicks ass! I designed two maps in one week that
			  together total over 500 sectors, all thanks to his
			  editor.

			  All the good wads I ever played for giving me inspiration.
			  (Especially those mentioned above.)

			  John Bye for boosting my ego a little and letting
			  me into the Black Star Coven. Check out the
			  homepage at the top (or close). Mail john and become
			  a beta tester and you get to play a bunch of mine and
			  Many other Top-Quality wad designers before anyone else.
			  Also, play johns cygnusiv.zip.
			  He's at jb54@le.ac.uk

			  Sverre Andre Kvernmo for designing the best levels
			  ever (cabal and others, some in the master levels).
			  He's also a pretty cool guy.
			  "Eternal Doom II just ain't the same without him."
			  Be sure to mail him (if you play his levels) and tell him
			  how good a level designer he is.

			  My dad for fixing (and breaking) the computer.
			  And testing my levels on skill 3.

			  Whoever made Zennode.

			  And a big Thank-You-Very-Fucking-Much to anyone who
			  emailed me and told me my wads kick ass (actually,
			  no ones ever mailed me to tell me other wise, so
			  play this wad and agree and mail me.)
			  It pisses me off to see all those mid-quality wads
			  (which will remain nameless, except for Raven.wad.
			  Dumb Fucker's now at Id, and his stuff is _UGH_).
			  get so much attention cause of their distribution.
			  Me and a million others, such as Patrick Martin or
			  Michael Krause or others (These guys get mentioned
			  cause they're cool) are much better level designers...
			  Oh well..,

PS: IF YOU STILL USE THE KEYBOARD; MAKE THE SWITCH (I RECENTLY DID).
YOU'LL KICK ASS TWICE AS MUCH AS BEFORE!
