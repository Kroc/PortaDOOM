			  Thanks. I needed that. 
			  -richard@radar.demon. something.
			  I have one thing to say: cooool. 
			  -Rob doell (doell@sklib.usask.sk.ca

			  I would greatly appreciate feedback on:
			  ammo/health: there's more than I need but I know
			  where everything is.
			  difficulty: too easy/hard
			  how much you loved it/hated it.

			  .zips I have made:
			  darker.zip: contains darker.wad, my first level
			  3_pack1.zip: contains ruler.wad, omelet.wad
			  and tekrkbrn.wad, better than most stuff
			  out there but nothing special
			  ds-61-2.zip: contains seven high-quality maps
			  alapolgy.wad: two very short levels
			  fromdrem.wad: a very short level from a dream
			  lab.wad: a high-tech lab
			  boom.wad: a ghost-town. The first room is
			  practically copied right out of dante's gate.
			  It's good though.
			  wasteme.wad: an untested (at point of release)
			  wad. I left out the exit switch (blush).
			  sinferno.wad: a okay hell wad.
			  quikisgd.zip: one of my more recent releases.
			  Short, high quality, and action packed.
		-...good, high quality level. Reminds me of e4m1
		-cmarti39@icon.net

			  Soon to come:
			  Skull.zip: skull.wad for doom 1
			  DS-61-3.zip: update of ds-61-2.zip
			  nosun2.zip: second of this series: the space ship at
			  the end (oh, so that's what it was)
			  

			  My fav. wads: Raven.wad (you know it)
					Mtfactor.wad. It's incredible!
					get it now!
					Darkcvnt.wad. The best!

Description             : This is the first of a series of .wads I am making.
			  I'm going to divide this into two parts:

Story                   : 2090: some research station orbiting earth.
			  "Um, professer," says a slave.
			  "What," snarls a half-man half-ape that couldn't
			  have passed grade school.
			  "The heat on earth is gradually decreasing. Less
			  light is coming this way each day. It appears
			  the sun is going out."
			  "That's impossible!" The professer kicks the slave.
			  "Look for yourself!" Says the slave a little to
			  quickly.
			  "You know I can't read!" The slave recieves another
			  kick.
			  Another slave somewhere down the corridor rolls
			  his eyes. The professer may have noticed yet is
			  already shouting into his comlink to get someone
			  "reputable" who _can_ read.

			  The nextday, same place.
			  "Welcome, Doctor appleberry." Says the apeman.
			  What a stupid name, thinks the slave, whose name
			  was recently changed to "shithead" by the professer.
			  "Read this," says shithead.
			  "Yes, he's right."

			  Several weeks later, you, a prisoner of war, get 
			  called in your cell somewhere in one of the less 
			  habitible places on earth. (Pollution has destroyed
			  nearly half the landcovered portion of the world,
			  with North America a cesspool of burning waste. The
			  ozone layer is so thin, 3 weeks of exposure
			  throughout your life would kill you.)
			  "You're going on a mission, you worthless piece of
			  shit. You better not fail me this time. Three strikes
			  and you're out."
			  You remember failing your first two impossible
			  missions and barely escaping with your life.
			  "Go to room 3a960236548079b.5 for briefing at 3:00"
			  (97% of earths population is now in prison.)

			  At 3:00 you wander down the long hall way towards
			  the room . "3a960236548079b.44, .46, .48, here we
			  are." You say to yourself. One stray step and you
			  would be toast: the walls are adorned with automatic
			  plasma cannons and other weapons trained on your
			  every move. You sigh and enter the room.
			  "Hello, sit down."
			  "Enough pleasantries. What mission have you got to
			  kill me off this time?"
			  "A mission to the sun. A few weeks ago we found out
			  that the sun is giving off less and less heat so
			  through the wonders of modern technology we sent
			  some spies in" says the hitler lookalike. "They
			  found some sort of alien space station that was
			  somehow poisoning our sun. Once it burns out they
			  know there will be no resistence from us, and they
			  can take our solar systems resources for free."
			  "Wait a minute," you say. "I know we can get to the
			  sun, and build materials strong enough to resist 
			  its heat, but its gravity's too strong. How did
			  you get this information. You can't even transmit
			  off it, let alone fly a ship off."
			  "Yes, but the aliens have much more advanced tech-
			  nology than us. They snuck on a saucer headed away
			  from us, and transmitted something off the ship.
			  Yet the aliens found them immediately thereafter
			  and, we believe, killed them.
			  "Your ship will be on automatic pilot until you are
			  too close to get away from the sun. There you will 
			  get on a saucer headed for their home planet. Then 
			  you will destroy their society from the inside out."
			  "WHAT! YOU'RE CRAZY!" you shout.
			  "We can kill you right here if you'd prefer."

		       
Layout                  : Large level. You start in some smaller hallways of
			  the space station, find the blue and red keys and
			  then jump out into a huge hallway where an old
			  service train used to run. you follow its path over
			  to some computer terminals. Then out to the surface
			  of the sun (YES, I know it wouldn't have walls but
			  how else was I supposed to do it.)
	 |                You get the yellow key and back to the beginning
   |\    |    /           where you exit the space station and into a docking
   |  \  |  /             bay where you get on a ship.
   |    \|/               I made special effort to make this a level with a
   |    /|\               view. By that I mean not only great textures where
   |  /  |  \             you are but also views into cool rooms that you can't
   |/    |    \           get to (in most cases).
	 |                There are four secrets: two are hidden doors and two
			  must be run to (over ledges etc.) One is only visible
			  on the map (not marked), one contains an automap.
			  And oh, yes, those marbfac4 posts at the beginning
			  (for those of you who aren't level designers, the 
			  faces with horns on them) are switches.
			  Anywhere outside hurts, whether you're in lava or
			  not. Get a suit or an invulnerability before you go
			  outside.

Additional Credits to   : Canada, Myself, iD, and the makers of dck. Without
			  it, I would still be trying to close a sector in 
			  deu.
================================================================

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : Map01
Single Player           : Yes, built for it. No FUCKING (there did I piss
			  off you yuppies yet) multiplayer switches.
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes, Extra Monsters-not tested though
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes, Extra Weapons, Closed off to a certain portion
			  of the map -not tested though
Difficulty Settings     : Yes. Play it in UV for the full experience.
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No. Just imagine the sky is whatever it would look
			  like on the sun. Or if you have dante's gate and
			  dck you can add dante's gate to your list of 
			  textures and then play and it will have a starry
			  sky which looks a lot better.
Demos Replaced          : None

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Build Time              : I would guess 10 hours. I have noticed that a lot of 
			  people design levels in forty hours that I design in
			  ten and there is a reason: choice of level editor.
			  Dck works with speed yet hides nothing from you.
			  You mat have noticed that this is a ridiculous
			  time for this size of level but it went by _very_
			  fast
Editor(s) used          : Dck 3.4, by far the very best editor. Try it, it 
			  kicks deus (and all the others) ass. Read the docs.  
Known Bugs              : nah!
