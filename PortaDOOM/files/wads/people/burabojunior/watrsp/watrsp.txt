Description             : Water Spirit is three maps I have made for a year,
                                  with lots of enemies and detailed architecture.
                                  The feel is intended to be slightly moody, but with lots
                                  of action and danger that will test the player.

                                  I hope this wad will be a memorable and fun experience.
                                  I'm really confident about the maps in this wad.
                                  I believe you will enjoy them if you check them out!
                                  Water Spirit has been tested in prboom-plus-2.5.1.4, zdoom-2.8.1 and gzdoom-bin-2-2-0-x64.
                                  I recommend you should use them.
