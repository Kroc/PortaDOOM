Author                  : Sverre Andre Kvernmo (aka "Cranium")
Misc. info              : This and the other of my wads were initially 
			intended released inside a 32-level "episode" on the 
			internet. I got drafted for id's project 
			"DOOM2: The Master Levels" though, and having Id 
			release four of my wads is about 666 times cooler<G>. 
			The remaining seven, now known as the CABAL series 
			didn't make it into that project, most of them due to 
			the deadline (I came into TML just as it was about to 
			be finished). After premiering on the coverdisks of 
			PC Zone and GIGA they are now available to all you 
			CIS & GAMESNET users.

			If you like these wads and want some more of my
			stuff, together with the excellent wads of Jim Flynn,
			John "Dr. Sleep" Anderson, Tom Mustaine and 
			Chris Klie you can go and get The Master Levels when 
			they come out. Very likely they'll be the best wads 
			you have _ever_ played...
			
Setting                 : Ok, here's the plot: Kick Butt!
			Gripping, isn't it? In case you are a little more
			into story-lines you can keep on reading <g>:
			The plot in the intended episode was as follows:
			
			: You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon 
			to rule hell and you spear-headed the council that 
			governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the
			other members you find yourself not only dismantled, 
			but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation:
			You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're
			out for revenge and have to kick the other members of 
			the Cabal's butts one by one.
			There's a short low-down on the story of each wad at 
			the end of this document (additional info).
			

Credits                 : The whole of id Software for DOOM & DOOM II.
			: Andrew (& Mark) Cornes, Gregory "Acoma" Hyne, 
			Peter "Pete" Ripley, David "Macca" Mccandless, 
			Jim F Flynn, Bjrnar Johansen, Baard Zakariassen and 
			Stian Danielsen for playtesting, viewpoints, 
			help, enthusiasm and for being mad bastards. 
			: Oh, and Erling Paulsen for managing to convince me
			that there was such a thing as a full fledged 
			Doom-editor, back in early 94. Os!
			: A brand new BFG goes out to Geoff Allan (DOOMed), 
			Raphael Quinet (DEU), Olivier Montanuy (DeuTex) and 
			Colin Reed (BSP) plus whoever put together idBSP. 
			These guys gave us tremendous tools of joy without
			claiming a buck for it. Keep going guys, you are much
			admired and respected. About a thousand times more
			so than those who are deeply doomed...;)
			: Shawn Green for sending me the picture of that 
			very friendly pizza-girl. Oh, and for including me in
			"DOOM2: The Master Levels" project.<G>
			: A humongous round of applause to those doom-players
			who still play without cheating. I made these wads
			for you guys! :)
			: Last but never least to all other WAD-designers who 
			have lost themselves in the worlds of tag numbers, 
			upper textures and vertexes as badly as me. Quake
			will be the end of what's left of our social lives.
			<G>

Deathmatch 
bad-arse credits        : Macca, Escher, Loki, Woof and Pete. You can 
			walk over my melted bodies anytime. Don't hang around 
			that corner for too long though. I'll silently BFG 
			your butt!

Base                    : An obsessive personality, lotsa caffeine and lotsa 
			nicotine. :Q A twiseted mind doesn't hurt either. :)
			An additional credit should go out to those wad-
			designers that have inspired me greatly through their 
			work. I don't know all their names, but the names of
			their WADs should suffice. Hail the hall of fame:
			"Nukemine" (old I know, but the supreme numero uno 
			at it's hayday)
			"Castle of the Renegades". Best castle-type wad I've 
			seen.
			"Eternity"
			"Dante's Gate"
			The secret level in the AlienDoom episode was groovy 
			as well, and "Cleimos" had some nice touches.
Build Time              : Don't ask, really! First baby steps at "wadding" 
			taken in the summer of 94. Almost dropped out of 
			university for this bloody obsession. One reason for 
			surviving was that I handed in a wad of my campus as 
			one of my projects. <G>
			I would guess that I on average spend about 130 hours 
			on each wad. And it's not because I work slow :)
Editor(s) used          : DoomED 4, DEU2, DETH, BSP1.2, idBSP and DEUTEX.
Bugs                    : No way. If you should find some then get in touch,
			but know that I will forever hate you!!! ;)

Where to get the 
CABAL wads              : Download it from Compuserve or get them from the 
			October issue of either PC Zone or GIGA (GIGA is only 
			sold in Norway). 
			Also available from the London GAMESNET server. 
			ftp:cdrom.com?

			Hope you enjoy the wads!

			Bloodflood (map 03)
			
			: I set out to make the ultimate deathmatch level in 
			this one. Once the players are fimiliar with the 
			level it kicks b u t t, ala big time. Works well
			as a 1player as well.
			
			"You have come upon one of the Cabal's blood-depoes. 
			An important element in any powerful black magic is 
			huge amounts of blood. Emptying the depoe's tanks 
			into the nearby river you will have struck your first 
			blow against the Cabal."  

==============================================================================
			
			Derelict Station (map 02)
			Co-author: Greg "Acoma" Hyne
			
			: Should you tire of Bloodflood (What!?) then try 
			this smaller, even faster frag-machine on for size. 
			Quite playable as a single game as well.

			"Just having escaped the Sea of Blood you have sought
			out a derelict building in the search for arms &
			equipment. Unfortunately the station isn't as 
			abandoned as you thought."

==============================================================================
   
			The Watchtower (map 04)
			Co-designer: Greg "Acoma" Hyne
			
			: Me and Greg wanted to do an awesome Deathmatch 
			level but with all the ideas we had it kinda grew a 
			little large <G>. Still very good if you have the 
			incentive to learn it. Good for 3 & 4 player network.

			
===============================================================================

			Temple of Death (map 05)

			:My first wad <blush>. Don't worry you won't have to 
			struggle with mis-aligned textures and collaged 
			colours, as I recently went over the thing and
			polished it a bit.

			
===============================================================================
			
			We who are About to Die (map 06)

			:Ok for Deathmatch but v e r y playable as one 
			player, judging by the response of play-testers.

			"The Cabal has started striking back at you. That 
			last gateway should have taken you... well somewhere 
			else. Not to an arena where thousands of humans have 
			lost their souls to hungry demons. As you get ready
			for the first wave of hellspawned gladiators you
			swear to blast the emperor's thumbs off before he can
			even think about turning them down on you..."

===============================================================================

			Eye of the Storm (map 09)

			: Made the whole level design with the thought of one
			encounter only (you'll know wich one when you 
			encounter it:). The level is an exercise in how to 
			dodge and use the BFG to full effect. If big-weapon 
			blasts are your thing in Deathmatch then you'll want to 
			live inside STORM.<G>

			"You find yourself in the remains of an old forttress                  
			after ascending a lift shaft from the mines where you
			were trapped. Signs of unlife is evident but from 
			what you know of this place it should pose no great 
			threat to you. It used to be the centre of a 
			Cacodemon empire that perished some 665 yeaes ago. 
			Oh, by the way, it's new years eve..."

==============================================================================                        
			
			The Image of Evil (map 30)
			
			: This was to be the final showdown in Cabal.
			Wanted to see how far I could take the design of the
			map view with it. Cowards go IDBEHOLDA as soon as they
			enter. Good players will see it evolve.
			
			"The Image of Evil is a humongous temple created 
			to the honour of the first Demon to slay an angel;
			Lithlaar. In it you will find the Cybo that now is
			known as the lord of Hell and his two Soulguards."
