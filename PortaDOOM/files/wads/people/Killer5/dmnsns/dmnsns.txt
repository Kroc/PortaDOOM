Description             : 5 maps designed for PrBoom+ complevel 9. Play on HNTR
						  or HMP. I spent the vast majority of time working on
						  HNTR and HMP for maps 01-03. UV is an extra special
						  difficulty that most likely only I will find fun.
						  
						  Maps31 and 32:
						  These two maps are special bonus maps. Only UV is
						  implemented for Map31. Map32 has HNTR, HMP, and UV
						  implemented but I recommend almost everyone play HNTR
						  on Map32.
						  
						  Difficulty descriptions:
						  HNTR: I dont really play slaughter/I rarely play slaughter
						  
						  HMP: I like slaughter maps but it definitely isnt my primary focus.
						  
						  UV: I love going up against overwhelming odds, fighting
						  tens (sometimes hundreds) of cybs/viles at a time, pain elemental 
						  swarms, Reality category of speedrunning.
						  
						  Due to the nature of these maps I recommend playing with infinite
						  height off in ZDoom based ports due to the flying monster behavior
						  mixed with high ceilings. These maps were designed for PrBoom+ cl9
						  which has vanilla flying monster behavior.
						  
						  Because of my mapping preferences play in software mode for best
						  visual results!
