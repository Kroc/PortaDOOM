TITLE MIDI: 'Mezame' - Mai Hime
INTERMISSION MIDI: 'The Final Battle' - Nostradameus

MAP01: The Burning Legion
MIDI: 'Absence Of Light' - Symphony X
Description:
	I wanted to make a map where the only limiting factor is the player.
	This map stays out of the players way and allows the player to kill
	stuff as fast as the player's skill permits. UV is comically difficult
	compared to HNTR, HMP and is a very different experience all together.
	Good Luck!


MAP02: Walking In The Void
MIDI: 'Watch Your Step' - Doom 64
Description:
	Inspired by my CS:S bhop days. I wanted to see platforms where the player
	needs to look up to see where the player should step next. Also there is a
	really fun gimmick fight after the player gets the bfg. Definitely one of my
	favorite encounters I have come up with. On UV it is by design that there is
	no hp in the ssg/rocket battle.


MAP03: Omega-Minor
MIDI: 'SA-X Approach' - Metroid Fusion, 'Suspense Remix' - Bobby Prince (original artist)
Description:
	Inspired by Slimer from Ghostbusters.. Slimer is green.. so I made a green map :P. 
	There are two well hidden elaborate secret fights in this map. I wanted to design something where 
	the players choices during play of a map directly impacts all the later fights in the map.
	
	Have fun!


MAP31: School's Out For Summer
MIDI: 'Bergschrund' - James Paddock
Description:
	Only UV is implemented.
	
	A map designed to be played without any regard for your own survival.
	
	Par time for UV-Max is 4:00.


MAP32: Bone-Nanza
MIDI: 'Legion Of Fear' - Knightrider Of Doom
Description:
	A very early map of mine that I decided to include. This map consists of three practice encounters
	I came up with to improve my playing in specific aspects.
	
	You should never be looking away from the cybs during the platforms fight.
	
	The finale is hilariously over the top.
	
	I suggest players play on HNTR or HMP.
