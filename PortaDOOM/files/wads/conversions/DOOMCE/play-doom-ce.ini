title="DOOM CE"
blurb=This mod builds on the existing total conversions of PlayStation DOOM and DOOM 64 for GZDoom, PSX DOOM TC and DOOM 64 Retribution, to take advantage of the latest GZDoom versions and adds many features that make them more faithful but were impossible to implement at their time of release.
