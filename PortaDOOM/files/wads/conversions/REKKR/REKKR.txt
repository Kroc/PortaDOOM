===========================================================================
Uploader note           : This is a minor update to 1.16 which replaces
                          three accidentally-included IWAD flats with
                          solid-color graphics, thus fully legalizing the
                          package. It also includes the REK_CREDS.txt file
                          found in its website's packages so you can see
                          who did each level and so on.
