Misc. Author Info       :

Description             : Paradise is a GZDoom TC, with a primary 7-map campaign,
			in addition to a 25-map episode of bonus maps. This version 2.1 release
			is a refinement of the 2019 2.0 release, adding ZDoom 2.8.1 and
			Zandronum compatibility, as well as adding coop multiplayer balance
			changes to the primary campaign (but not the bonus maps).

			To play Paradise, drag paradise-v2.1.pk3 on to the .exe for the
			sourceport of your choice. You will need a copy of doom2.wad in
			the same folder as your sourceport, or otherwise configured.
			You can download GZDoom here: https://zdoom.org/downloads
			Or download Zandronum here: https://zandronum.com/download
			
			Hardware-accelerated rendering mode strongly recommended, both for
			visual and performance reasons. Make sure you bind your reload key!
			Be sure to check out the "Mod Options" section in the main
			menu for options to customize your experience.
			
			The primary Paradise campaign contains 5 standard maps, and 2 secret
			maps. The bonus episode, selectable from the main menu, contains 25
			maps that are either speedmaps or rejects of mine from the last few
			years, that would otherwise go unreleased. The bonus episode is
			therefore of notably lower quality than the primary campaign;
			players should proceed at their own risk when playing the bonus
			episode!

			Paradise features a greatly modified and expanded bestiary and arsenal,
			along with a number of other gameplay and visual changes. Gibs and
			alternate monster deaths, de-randomized monster and player damage,
			instant weapon switching, and built-in (optional) pistol starts are
			among some of the changes included in Paradise. See section
			"C. GAMEPLAY CHANGES" below for more information on these changes.
			
			All maps in Paradise have been balanced for pistol starts, but playing
			continuous is perfectly valid too. All maps in Paradise have been
			balanced accordingly for each skill level, though the bonus maps
			have received much less gameplay tuning than the primary campaign.
			
			Paradise is inherently unfriendly to custom gameplay mods due to its
			extensive gameplay changes. Proceed at your own risk if coupling
			Paradise with other gameplay mods. However, players are more than
			welcome to create their own patches or versions of Paradise that
			are mod-friendly, given that Paradise can be modified/remixed/reuploaded
			without permission. See section "E. EXTENDED CREDITS" below for more
			information.

===========================================================================
				A. PROJECT INFORMATION
===========================================================================

Paradise is result of my vision to combine modern gameplay mod capabilities
with challenging, tightly-balanced gameplay. There is a great volume
of fun, challenging work out there for vanilla or limit-removing Doom (Sunlust
and Resurgence being among my favorites), but I've come across very few maps
that retain that style of gameplay that I enjoy while also making use of the new
capabilities that (G)ZDoom affords. Paradise is my response to that (perceived)
absence.

The gameplay mod built in to Paradise (which is called Supercharge, and has been
released standalone on the Doomworld forums:
https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/109107-supercharge-gzdoom-resourcegameplay-mod/)
was heavily inspired by Complex Doom, and for that I owe Daedalus
(creator of Complex Doom) a huge thanks, because Paradise would not exist
without that inspiration.

Many of the new monsters featured in Paradise were built to introduce new, novel
behavior into Doom that, in turn, introduced the potential for new, novel
gameplay and combat scenarios.

Compared to the 2019 v2 release, v2.1 has a number of small tweaks across the
maps in the main episode, along with new multiplayer items and monsters in the
main episode. Note that the bonus maps do _not_ have any new multiplayer
balancing - if you are going to play those maps in coop, proceed at your own risk!

Compared to the 2018 v1 release, Paradise v2 has 4 new main episode maps, along
with all the new bonus maps, as well as a number of other gameplay changes,
custom options, and more.

===========================================================================
				B. RECOMMENDED COMPANION MODS
===========================================================================

Paradise will likely break if you try to run it with other gameplay mods.
However, many modern quality-of-life mods work perfectly fine with Paradise,
and are in fact recommended if you fancy them. Here are some mods that I
frequently use when playing Paradise:

	- Damnums (by Xaser):
		URL: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55048
	
	- Tilt++ (by Nash):
		URL: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=55413
		
	- Target Spy (by m8f):
		URL: https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=60784

===========================================================================
				B. GAMEPLAY CHANGES
===========================================================================

/******** GENERAL ********/
	- Gibs and alternative deaths for monsters across the board. Which death
		animation plays is often dependent on the type of weapon used to kill
		the monster, as well as the distance. No hitboxes though - this is all
		purely cosmetic.
	- 2 new HUDs (one minimal, one expanded), which can be cycled using the
		plus (+) and minus (-) keys by default.
	- Bullet casings, terrain splashes, per-item pickup sounds, color-coded
		pickup messages, etc.
	- Automatic pistol starts if enabled in the options menu (Main Menu ->
		Options -> Paradise Options -> Pistol start)
	- De-randomized damage for monsters and players alike. Every attack now does
		set pre-set amount of damage. In the case of most monster attacks, their
		new damage values are the average of what their old, randomized values
		would be. In the case of the player, any weapon changes not
		significantly altered from vanilla tend to do more on the upper end of
		the previous random scale, rather than the average.
		
/******** NEW MENU OPTIONS ********/
New options are accessible via Main Menu -> Mod Options, which are primarily cosmetic.

/******** WEAPONS ********/
	- Fist: No major changes.
	- Chainsaw: Triggering the Cyber Baronâs pain state with a chainsaw is a
		guaranteed disarm. Damage has been increased. No other major changes.
	- Pistol: Shots are much more powerful, and much faster, than vanilla,
		but at the cost of having to reload every 8 bullets.
	- Shotgun: Fires faster, has tighter horizontal spread but with equal
		vertical spread. Can fire 8 shells before reload.
	- Super Shotgun: Slightly tighter horizontal spread, and a few frames faster
		at firing too. Really powerful as a combo-ender (ie 4 scrap
		shell shots into instant SSG) thanks to instant weapon switching.
	- (NEW) Scrap Gun: Projectile shotgun. Does a ton of damage up close, but
		its extreme spread makes it unideal for anything but short-range.
	- Chaingun -> Assault Rifle: Fires in 3 round bursts, and reloads after
		45 shots. Bullets are significantly more powerful than the vanilla
		Chaingun.
	- Rocket Launcher: Significantly increased rate of fire, and faster
		projectile speed. The cost is that splash damage, and therefore overall
		damage, are nerfed. Direct hits therefore are much more important. Works
		well as both a combo starter and ender.
	- Plasma Rifle: Reloads every 40 shots. Otherwise, quite similar to its
		vanilla counterpart in terms of damage output and speed. Used in
		only in the bonus maps.
	- BFG9000: No major changes.
	
	Note that there is a menu option to enable automatic reloading when a
	weapon becomes empty (Main Menu -> Mod Options -> Auto reload weapons on empty).


/******** MONSTERS ********/
	- (NEW) Diabolist: Fiery-red cousin of the Archvile. Summons exploding
		plumes of fire beneath the playerâs feet that linger for a few moments
		for area-denial. Punishes you for not watching your footwork.
	- (NEW) Tortured Soul: Similar to a Cacodemon, but releases out lingering
		toxic clouds, which damage players and other monsters alike, upon pain
		and death. Think of them like flying barrels.
	- (NEW) Pyro Demon: A hell-knight variant whose projectile explodes into
		small chunks of fire that linger on the ground upon impact. Lingering
		fire is constant but low damage, for area denial.
	- Archvile -> Exile: 100 more HP than vanilla. Otherwise purely a cosmetic
		change.
	- Baron of Hell -> Cyber Baron: Has a chance to fire a rocket out of its
		rocket arm, in addition to its regular green fireball attack. Once under
		~50% health, a strong attack (anything but a pistol/AR attack basically)
		will destroy its rocket arm, leaving it with only the green fireball
		attack. Its rockets (which are now distinct from player rockets) deal
		slightly less damage and have a smaller explosion radius than vanilla.
	- Zombieman -> Plasma Zombie: Fires two shots of plasma instead of a single
		hitscan bullet.
	- Cyberdemon: Has 25% less health than vanilla, and is now susceptible to
		explosion/radius damage. Its rockets (which are now distinct from player
		rockets) deal slightly less damage and have a smaller explosion radius
		than vanilla.
	- Demon -> MechaDemon: Walks and bites faster than its vanilla counterpart.
		During its attack animation, takes increased damage.
	- Cacodemon: Fires slower projectiles than its vanilla counterpart. During
		its attack animation, takes increased damage.
	- Imp: Fires slightly faster projectile than its vanilla counterpart.
	- Lost Soul: Significantly less HP than its vanilla counterpart.
	- Pain Elemental: Has a small, damaging explosion upon death, to make it
		slightly less safe to stay in its face to block Lost Souls from spawning
		upon death.
	- Mancubus -> Behemoth: Same stats as its vanilla counterpart, but fires its
		projectiles out of its cannons now, rather than the center of its body,
		making the projectiles a little tougher to dodge.
	- Arachnotron -> Fusionite: Same stats as its vanilla counterpart, but fires
		its projectiles in strings of 4 with a small gap in between each bunch.


===========================================================================
				D. MAP INFO
===========================================================================

Below are some notes on the history of each map, along with each map's music
credits. This information is really not much more than trivia, and is not
required to play Paradise.

Title music: "Do U R [Staff Roll]" from Grounseed
Intermission music: "Flashback [Ranking]" from Armed Police Batrider


===================
MAP01: Sewer Surfing
===================
Music: "Chasing Gang, Need 4 Speed [Stage 5 Highway]" from Armed Police Batrider
Alt midi music: ??? from Descent

This map was the last map created for v1 of Paradise. After player feedback on
the v1 iteration, I reworked this map to be a more gentle introduction to the
episode, while still being able to retain most of the map structure and pathing.
I intended to completely replace this map with a new one for v2, but as I was
nearing completion on the replacement-to-be, I decided that a simple rework of
the existing MAP01 would serve as a better opener for Paradise than the new map.


===================
MAP02: Acid Jungle
===================
Music: "Easy To Go [Stage 1 Manhattan City]" from Armed Police Batrider
Alt MIDI music: "Web Spider" from Mega Man X4

This map was originally a speedmap from 2014 for an unfinished MBF project that
I began working on after Mayan Mishap. The project never progressed
substantially beyond the single speedmap, so I eventually repurposed it for
Paradise later.

The map has received some minor visual and gameplay adjustments from v1, but not
a lot was changed.


===================
MAP03: Hyper Safari
===================
Music: "Night Sweeper (Stage 7)" from Hyper Duel
Alt MIDI music: "Departure" from Duke Nukem 3D

This map is originally based off map01 in ZaBigBoss' Back to Thunder Road (2016),
though there's not much left here from that map. Initially my plan was to take
that map01, scale it up slightly, and add some jungle visuals, but it quickly
turned into a much larger map as I developed the jungle theme further and
further.

The map has received some minor visual changes from its v1 iteration, as well
as a number of gameplay changes that significantly tone down the difficulty. The
original v1 map was admittedly pretty bonkers on UV.


===================
MAP04: Emerald Babylon
===================
Music: "Degeneracy" from Battle Garegga
Alt MIDI music: "Plantation Crash" from Zone 66

New to v2. The first half of the map is based on a speedmap I did after creating
Paradise v1 (that speedmap is included in the bonus episode as MAP53). Adapting
the speedmap into the Paradise theme was essentially the catalyst for creating
Paradise v2.


===================
MAP05: A Sickly Earth
===================
Music: "The Red Naval Port" from 19XX: The War Against Destiny
Alt MIDI music: "Credits" from Descent II

New to v2. This map is a mish-mash of reworked and retuned speedmaps, though a
few areas are brand new.

The creation of this map turned out to be a real struggle. Some parts, such as
the central jungle area and the main diamond Archvile fight in the north, were
created without too much second thought, but every other area of the map went
through at least 2 completely different iterations that I scrapped. At one point
I considered giving up on this map and just making MAP04 the last main map in
Paradise v2. I'm very glad that I keep going though, because this turned out to
be my favorite map in the whole thing, both in terms of gameplay and visuals.
What's not to love about fights with gaggles of Diabolists and multiple
Cyberdemons??


===================
MAP31: Forbidden Zone
===================
Music: "Sacred Cave" / "Forbidden Area" from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

New to v2, though this map was teased at the end of Paradise v1. The gameplay
concept for the first room was heavily inspired by a speedmap by rdwpa, but all
fights in the map were planned out textually on paper before I started actually
making the map in Doom Builder. The two secret fights were added quite late in
the map's development.


===================
MAP32: A Portrait of Flames
===================
Music: "Portrait of a Ghost Ship" from Castlevania Rondo of Blood

New to v2, and also based entirely off a speedmap from late 2018 (included in
the bonus episode as MAP56). This and MAP31 were initially to be part of a
totally separate, non-Paradise episode, but I struggled to create/finish other
maps in the episode, and instead included these maps here as secret maps to
help break up the jungle theme from the main maps.



/******** BONUS MAPS ********/

This bonus episode is comprised of speedmaps and other scrapped maps of mine
from the last few years. Some of these bonus maps have received substantial work
on them to make them more polished in terms of both visuals and gameplay, but
generally, they are of far lesser quality than the main Paradise episode.

All bonus maps are playable from start to finish (pistol-starts intended), and
have received some gameplay tuning across difficulty levels. Most bonus maps
titles are just their development titles (mostly 30mXX from my 30+ minute
speedmap series, or spdXX from my older general speedmap series).

!!!! Please play these bonus maps at your own risk !!!!

They are intended to be fun, but nothing is guaranteed. As with the main
Paradise maps, feel free to rip anything from these maps.


===================
MAP33: 30m14b
===================
Music: "Cemetery" from Castlevania Rondo of Blood

Originally a ~30 minute speedmap, significantly reworked and overhauled into its
current state. Very heavily inspired by Gusta's work in Plutonia 2. This was
another map that was intended to be in a separate gothic-themed episode along
with MAP31 and MAP32. I ended up feeling kind of lukewarm about this map's
gameplay after finishing this rework, but I'm pretty happy with the visuals at
least.


===================
MAP34: Sightless Nest (30m31)
===================
Music: MAP16 from TNT: Evilution

Heavily inspired by MAP32 of Sunlust, as the texturing and music would suggest.
I speedmapped this layout in a few hours, then came back many months later to
put some finishing touches on the layout and add all the gameplay. Kind of basic
in design I guess, but I really enjoy how the fights turned out here.


===================
MAP35: 30m24
===================
Music: "Degeneracy" from Battle Garegga

Heavily inspired by MAP18 of Resurgence.


===================
MAP36: spd02
===================
Music: "Simon's Theme" from Super Castlevania IV

A pretty old speedmap, dating back to early 2017. The music of Castlevania IV
has been a pretty big influence on my mapping at times, as its usage in this map
and a few other bonus maps might suggest. For release in this bonus episode, I
made some quick edits to the map and added monsters, though it's admittedly a
pretty barebones effort.


===================
MAP37: unholy02
===================
Music: "Pillared Corridor" from Super Castlevania IV

Plucked from a 3-map speedmap episode called "Unholy", whose other maps are
elsewhere in this bonus episode. Built around the idea for a fight that forces
the player to dance around on a tight catwalk while dodging Diabolist fire.


===================
MAP38: spd04
===================
Music: "Forest of Monsters" from Super Castlevania IV

Another older speedmap. The layout itself has been completed for a few years,
but I never implemented gameplay in the map until recently, after deciding to
release it as part of this bonus episode. "Starlit library" is a theme I'd very
much love to explore more in the future.


===================
MAP39: 30m5
===================
Music: "Rusty Nails" by Jimmy, from Speed of Doom

Inspired by Hobomaster's maps.


===================
MAP40: 30m3
===================
Music: "Wily Stage 1 - Entrance" from Mega Man 7

Inspired by the end of MAP01 of Combat Shock 2.


===================
MAP41: spd17
===================
Music: ??? from Descent

Older speedmap inspired by Richard Wiles' "dickie" series.


===================
MAP42: 30m26
===================
Music: "Nesting in the Sands" from Contra III: The Alien Wars

Vaguely inspired by TimeOfDeath's ESP2.


===================
MAP43: 30m10
===================
Music: "Underground Reservoir" from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

Another green hell/gothic speedmap from around the time I was working on
MAP31 and interested in that theme.


===================
MAP44: 1ntru
===================
Music: "Splash Down!! ~Planet Undertow~" from Ristar

Originally made ~2011, as a speedmap for 1ntru's birthday. Was going to be part
of a 32-map Boom megawad that I intended to make at the time, but didn't get
very far with.


===================
MAP45: utow02
===================
Music: "Clock Tower Casualty" from Castlevania Harmony of Dissonance

Made around the same time as MAP44.


===================
MAP46: unholy03
===================
Music: "Den" from Castlevania Dracula X

Unfinished finale from speedmap episode "Unholy". The map is still completely
playable and exitable, but past the first fight, the player can run straight to
the exit. I'd still like to expand on this map sometime in the future, because
this music track is too good to not use in a big slaughtermap.


===================
MAP47: unholy01
===================
Music: "Dracula's Theme" from Super Castlevania IV

First map of "Unholy", and pretty underwhelming. Conceptually it's ok I think:
player approaches spooky gothic structure from the dark forest, and does some
battle in the dark interior, with windows out into the foreboding sunset, etc.
But I wasn't able to do the concept justice with the short time that I gave
myself to make the map - though I imagine I'd still struggle to do it justice
even _with_ ample time.


===================
MAP48: 30m30
===================
Music: "Map C" from Super Castlevania IV

Inspired by Jodwin's MAP29 in Claustrophobia 1024 2: The Mystery of Too Many
Maps.


===================
MAP49: 30m21
===================
Music: "Stage 2" from Dragon Saber

This speedmap was an experiment with ice physics, to explore the viability of
fights designed around such physics. I think there's still some potential, but
I don't know that this map really ended up being a compelling demonstration of
the idea. It's got a cool music track though, at the very least.


===================
MAP50: 30m9
===================
Music: "Hot Head Bop" from Donkey Kong Country II

Speedmap for me to experiment with the scrap gun and catwalks.


===================
MAP51: python
===================
Music: ??? from Descent

Quite heavily inspired by Sunder map01, as the map name, music, and visuals
suggest. Also served as a playground for the scrap gun. I like the first room
a lot, but I'm pretty lukewarm on the rest of it.


===================
MAP52: 30m8
===================
Music: "Lunatic Pandora" from Final Fantasy VIII

Another scrap gun experiment. Unlike most of the other 30mXX speedmaps that
ended up taking more than 30 minutes to make, I think this map stayed within or
was quite close to the 30 minute limit.


===================
MAP53: 30m19
===================
Music: "Underground Reservoir" from Castlevania Aria of Sorrow

Semi-speedmap inspired by Death-Destiny's map No Chance. I used this map as
basically a testing ground for a bunch of fight ideas, some of which ended up
getting used in the main Paradise episode.


===================
MAP54: 30m1
===================
Music: ??? (taken from D2XGold; probably a metal song from the 90s)

Straightforward slaughter speedmap, inspired by an image I saw in the Post Your
Doom Picture thread on Doomworld at some point.


===================
MAP55: 30m42
===================
Music: "Dilemma" from Chrono Cross

Inspired by some of Mechadon's progress screenshots on Supplice that he shared
sometime in 2019. This was originally going to possibly be the start of another
main episode Paradise map, but I pretty quickly gave up on the map. Near the end
of Paradise v2 development, I gave the map a visual overhaul, changing it from
the Paradise dark metal theme to this BSTONE-heavy theme. I'm not too fond of
the map's gameplay, but the visual overhaul was a good means of theme
exploration.


===================
MAP56: 30m2
===================
Music: "Wily Stage 3 - Walk the Invisible" from Mega Man 7

Inspired by MAP10 of Unidoom DM 3 (UDM3). In terms of gameplay, I started with
the idea of alternating Diabolist/Archvile turrets that the player has to play
around, and built the rest of the map from there. Made in ~45 minutes.

This map was later revamped and turned into MAP32.


===================
MAP57: 30m25
===================
Music: "Credits" from Descent II

Inspired by the maps in TimeOfDeath's ESP2, as well as one of rdwpa's speedmaps.
Probably took around an hour for the initial version. The driving gameplay
concept was a small arena that slowly revealed and reconnected to itself.

This map was later used as the basis for the main outdoor area in MAP05.

Vyre for playtesting so extensively, and doing so for multiple iterations of
Paradise v2.
