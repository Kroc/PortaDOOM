Ashes: Dead Man Walking, an Ashes 2063 Map set by ReformedJoe.


To run:
1.Ensure your GZDoom is up to date

2. Get the latest Ashes 2063 map and mod file:
https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=47573
(The MAIN files, not the sterilized edition)

3. After that you will need to load the DMW .pk3 AFTER the base files, using either a shortcut,
or a launcher of your choice. Again, load DMW AFTER the base files or funky errors may occur.

4. If everything works, you will see "Dead Man Walking" in the episode list. Enjoy.
