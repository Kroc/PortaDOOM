Description             : SKULLDASH OVERVIEW:
                          Welcome to Skulldash, the fast-paced speedrun arcade mod For
                          Doom II. The objective in skulldash is to collect the
						  Skulltokens scattered around each level to unlock the exit.
						  
						  While collecting the Skulltokens you have to race against the
						  clock, as there is a time limit to beat – all while defending
						  yourself from the hordes of monsters from hell.
						  
						  
						  FAST PACED GAMEPLAY:
						  While on the hunt for the hundreds of Skulltokens scattered
						  across the various realms, you’re having to race against the
						  clock! Failure to beat the level in the permitted time will
						  cause you, the player, to be splattered into many pieces.
						  
						  Fear not, however, hidden throughout most levels are many
						  secret areas containing blue Skulltokens, which add a precious
						  five seconds to the clock.
						  
						  
						  LARGE LEVEL SELECTION:
						  With twenty standard levels, four boss levels, five bonus
						  levels, a giant level-hub (and a tutorial) you’ve got plenty
						  of hours of gameplay available!
						  
						  Skulldash takes you to many realms & locations, including but
						  not limited to technical bases, aztec temples, icy caverns, in
						  a submarine, on a series of treetops, in hell, a haunted
						  mansion, a medieval castle, a jungle altar, high in the sky
						  and even in space!
						  
						  
						  BOSSES, SECRETS & BONUS MAPS:
						  Every level has a plethora of secret areas, containing bonus
						  equipment and Skulltokens – keep your eye out if you want to
						  go for 100% completion – when you 100% a full tier of
						  levels, you unlock a bonus level!
						  
						  At the end of each Tier (except the 1st) there is an action
						  packed boss map. Each boss is found in an environment
						  crafted around their strengths and weaknesses. Bosses are
						  often accompanied by hordes of hellspawn to assist them in
						  taking you out. Prepare yourself to face the Lava Golem, the
						  Dark Inquisitor, the Gate Keeper & the Overlord!
