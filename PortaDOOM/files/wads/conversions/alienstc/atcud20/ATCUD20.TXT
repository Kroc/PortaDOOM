AL|ENS TOTAL CONVERSION for Ultimate DOOM, Revision 2.0
=======================================================

This is an updated version of the classic Aliens Total Conversion designed
to work with modern DOOM source ports.

This version remedies texture problems including the hand rails and HOMs,
critical bugs such as bad sidedefs and non-functional doors, addresses a few
playability issues such the one-use switch in E2M7, fixes not being able to
win the game in E2M8, includes a few minor balance tweaks such as amount of
ammo/health in different difficulty levels, and a few minor aesthetic repairs
have been made.

I have NOT gone out of the way to change texture alignment or theme in any
but a few minor cases. I feel the appearance of the levels is part of the
true atmosphere of this total conversion and shouldn't be altered.

The ATCUD19.DEH file is intact from the original version and includes no
fixes except for changing the cyberdemon into an alien queen. The ATCUD19.BEX
file is for use with BOOM-derived source ports, and includes fixes for
various problems along with BEX-style text strings. You should use the BEX
patch if your port supports it. ZDOOM is known to have issues with the
original DEH patch, and has not been tested with the BEX patch. Functionality
with the ZDOOM port is *NOT* guaranteed. This TC has been tested with BOOM,
MBF, and SMMU.

This TC *REQUIRES* the Ultimate DOOM v1.9 IWAD to play, it is NOT compatible
with DOOM II. This TC does not make use of any extended port features in the
wad files themselves.

To play the TC, launch your favorite port with the following command-line
options. A response file may be necessary, and if your port's dehacked
command-line parameter is different, you should substitute it for -deh:

-file alitcsf.wad alitcsnd.wad atclev.wad -deh [atcud19.deh | atcud19.bex]

Where [atcud19.deh | atcud19.bex] means you should choose one or the other.

Other options can be provided at your discretion. See your port's
documentation for other things you can do.

Information on this TC can be found in some ports by pressing the F1 key.
In BOOM-derived ports you may cycle through multiple screens to see info on
some other upcoming projects... :)
