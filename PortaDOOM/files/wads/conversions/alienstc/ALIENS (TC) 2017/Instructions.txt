INSTRUCTIONS

This is a stand-alone mod, you don't need to combine it with Aliens (TC), or any other mod.

Works exclusively with episodes 2 and 3 of Ultimate Doom. This mod is not meant to be played with other levels.

After you unzip the file, select all of the files in the "ALIENS (TC) 2017" folder. Drag and drop the files over an up-to-date version of GZDoom.

For more recent versions of GZdoom, I also recommend turning on the bloom-effect.It gives the flashlight a clearer, and more realistic look.
