Description             : This is a dehacked patch designed to emulate the
                          chex.exe executable included with Chex Quest.  It
                          is generated from a comparison of chex.exe with
                          Final Doom's doom2.exe.

* Notes *

The purpose of this patch is to allow Chex Quest to be played accurately with
source ports; it will not work with Vanilla Doom and DOS dehacked, as some of
the string and cheat replacements are longer than is possible with dehacked.

Because of the limitations of dehacked, it is not possible to completely
emulate chex.exe merely with a dehacked patch.  Although this patch takes
care of the majority of the changes necessary, the following changes are also
necessary to accurately emulate chex.exe:

 * Monsters should not drop ammo
 * The game should end after the fifth level, instead of the eighth.
 * The episode selection screen should not be displayed.
 * The level warp cheat should always warp to episode 1.
 * The automap should show the level name for the episode 1 level,
   eg. the displayed level name for E2M3 is the level name for 
       E1M3.

The latest version of Chocolate Doom has been extended to include a mode which
applies these changes.
