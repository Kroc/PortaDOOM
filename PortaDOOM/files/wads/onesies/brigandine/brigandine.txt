Misc. Author Info       : Itinerant iOS developer and full-time shitbird.

Description             : A running battle through a twisty terraced
                          city of brick, iron and skin. A well-meaning
                          attempt to make a singleplayer map that would
                          flow like a deathmatch one. Secretly just a love
                          letter to BRWINDOW.

                          Inspired by Crucified Dreams, BTSX Episode 2,
                          Gravity Rush, Doom 2016 and Kowloon Walled City.

                          my shit and to Onionbob for falling in love with
                          Doom again.
