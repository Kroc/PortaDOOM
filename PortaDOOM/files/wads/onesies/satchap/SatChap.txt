+-+-+SATURNINE CHAPEL+-+-+
(Or, if you will, MNENMA 0)
Dreamer: Foslanp Lakob
Intended Difficulty: Skill 3 "Normal"
Entry from "Rending of the Veil: Journals and Diaries from the Astral
Plane", Chapter 6:

"I write of sorrow, yes, I write of things most ill.

A wild sickness has consumed me; my fever dreams have broken into a
delirium far worse than I thought possible. And yet therein those rancid
visions I have found it--the monument; my muse; the twilight tower. My 
eyes ne'er stray from its enchaned floors and page-encrusted walls, my 
soul kept rapt amidst tomes of forbidden knowledge. I truly swear that 
I had once wished to be free--this a delicate, erstwhile truth--but brought 
low am I, on boneless knees before the profane glory of the saturnine 
chapel! My fingernails bend and crook into the shape of pens, my crimson 
blood congealing into a tarry ink. I stand as scribe eternal to the wonders 
that have been revealed to me, my sick and aching body the perfect vessel 
for corporeal transcriptions.

So I shall write of sorrow, yes, I shall craft things most ill!"
