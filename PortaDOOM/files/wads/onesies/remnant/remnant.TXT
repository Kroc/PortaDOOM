Misc. Author Info       : Been mapping on/off for almost 15 years (mostly off),
                          but never really finished a project. After playing
                          Eviternity and some 2018 Cacoaward winners, I felt 
                          like getting back into it. Beyond video games,
                          I teach mathematics to high school kids.

Description             : Remnant is a large limit-removing map for Doom 2, 
                          using the OTEX texture pack by ukiro and centered 
                          around creating a vanilla-ish gameplay experience 
                          within a detailed, atmospheric setting. The map
                          features large open environments, both outdoors and 
                          indoors, with medieval and hellish elements combined
                          with lush and organic outdoor scenery. Encounters 
                          can often be approched from different perspectives, 
                          and the open environments give way for momentum based 
                          battles that take advantage of said open space. While 
                          the monster count may be high, the map is not designed 
                          as a slaughtermap; monster encounters are situated 
                          evenly along the length of the playthrough.
