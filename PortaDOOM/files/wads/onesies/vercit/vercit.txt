Description             : You've reached the shore of the Verdant Citadel,
                          a stone bulwark on an island in an endless sea.
                          It is inhabited by undead demonic caretakers
                          who are responsible for keeping blood-thirsty,
                          pain-delivering space marines like you from
                          gaining a foothold. But that's never given you
                          any pause before...

                          Narrative fluff aside, I wanted to get better at
                          non-linear layouts so ended up making this map.
                          It is about as non-linear as I could stand to
                          make it, and as a result there are a few ways to
                          approach it. Some routes are a little easier,
                          some a little harder. Playtime is estimated
                          between 25 and 35 minutes at Ultra-Violence.

                          Recommended to be played with GZDoom's lights.pk3
                          and brightmaps.pk3. Compatible with the sprite
                          fixes and brightmaps from
                          https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=36713
                          (d2spfx19.wad and gzd_brightmaps*.pk3)

                          The color grading effect used by this map might
                          not work well on some hardware\software. If the
                          title map's colors are distorted or you just want
                          to disable it, there is an option to do so in the
                          Display options > Hardware renderer >
                          Postprocessing menu, or you can set the
                          r_colorgrading console variable to false.

                          Jumping and crouching are disabled through MAPINFO
                          as the map is not designed with those options in
                          mind, but freelook is available.
