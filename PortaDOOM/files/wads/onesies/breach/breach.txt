Other Files By Author   : A handful of enthusiastically bad deathmatch wads
                          from the early 90s.
Misc. Author Info       : I make mobile games for a living and develop
                          Boxer (http://boxerapp.com), a DOSBox emulator
                          port for OS X. This is my first Doom map in about
                          20 years. (Christ.)

Description             : Sprawling techbase medley with surreal interludes
                          in hell. Assume the usual twaddle about
                          teleportation research gone awry.

                          This was an exercise in using the original Doom 2
                          textures and specials to build something very
                          modern: with intricate spaces, long vistas and a
                          bunch of half-assed environmental storytelling.
                          Inspired by No Rest for the Living, Visions of
                          Eternity, Vaporware Demo and Metroid Prime.

                          (This represents about half of the map I had
                          planned before I hit the seg limit; I may finish
                          the second half at some point before the Earth
                          finally plunges into the Sun.)

                          design advice.
