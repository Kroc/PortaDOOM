Description             : A big nonsensical challenge map; gets metaphysical in places.

The Story		: You're back from your victory over the gatekeeper of Hell,
			  but upon arriving home are informed that no-one is aware of your
			  successes or is at all willing to believe they happened. They put
			  you in quarantine for three weeks and the stress snaps your mind,
			  yanking you back into an imaginary hell where you don't even get to
			  use the super shotgun. Oh no, you say. OH NO.

Additional Credits to   : Tarnsman's streams where he points out what is wrong about a level -
			  I broke every rule that I could remember!
