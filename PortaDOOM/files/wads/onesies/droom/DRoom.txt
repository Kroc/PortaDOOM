Description             : Boom compatible (cl9) single level for Doom 2. Tech-bases installed into black, gray and green caverns.
                          This map is designed to be difficult (harder then my previous maps). 
                          I suggest to start on HMP and, eventually, give UV a try when you know well the map.

Additional Credits to   : id Software and the authors of DB2, SLADE 3, WhackEd4. 
                          Ribbiks for creating the low life green cybers presents in this map, which I taked from                                                  finely_crafted_fetish_film.wad.
