Description             : The map is about a Marine who must infiltrate a large
						  base of the UAC corporation because there are indications
						  that secret experiments related to portals and Satanism
						  are taking place. The protagonist hides in a UAC truck
						  that goes to the complex and get infiltrated.
						  But once inside the facilities he realizes that something
						  terrible has happened there, it seems that he is not the 
						  only unexpected visitor...
