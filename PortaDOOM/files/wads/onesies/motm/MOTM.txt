									Man on the Moon

"Man on the Moon" is a boom compatible map that was designed in about a year (on and off, give or take a few more more months) and it is a rather large map.
It serves as a sequel to my previously released "Travelling to the Moon" and, this time, well as the title suggests, it actually takes place on the moon (at least some 
moon). It has more of a focus on set pieces and incidental combat rather than a succesion of arena fights. It still has a few arenas here and there but, I thought I'd mix
things up to make it a little more interesting (hopefully). 


The map is quite hard but, still manageable. 

======================================================================================================================================================

Advanced engine needed  : PRBOOM+ at the least (tested with), complevel 11 (mbf). I suppose zdoom/gzdoom is also fine
Primary purpose         : Single player

                          There should've been a track from perturbator ("I am the night") for the zdoom/gzdoom specific music (like in the first travmoon) but, unfortunately, 
                          i did not recieve any answer to the email I sent. Maybe I will eventually, who knows haha

May Not Run With...     : Doom95.exe, Chocolate doom. 

This map was not tested with gameplay mods and thus, I don't really know if it runs with mods such as smoothdoom for example (due to the dehacked boss). You may try but, 
I won't be responsible if things break haha. 

======================================================================================================================================================

* Aditional notes *

The map was tested primarilly with prboom+ (2.5.1.4) and thus, is the intended port. The map runs ok in gzdoom, etc... though (not tested in zandronum).
Due to the boss using mbf specific codepointers, unfortunately, I don't think it works in zdaemon... 

Also, jumping and crouching is disabled by default and it should stay that way. The map was not designed for ports that allow these so if you encounter bugs that are the result
of you jumping and crouching around, I will not be responsable. You are warned ;)
