Misc. Author Info       : I mostly just make speedmaps, and this kind of fits that.

Description             : Originally a map for Jimmy's Joy Of Mapping 5, I ended up pulling it as it had gotten too large
                          and ambitious, and its size & length would have really bogged down what was already a hefty
                          community project. This allowed me the chance to polish the map up to a higher standard, as the
                          original JOM project limited mapping time to only 72 hours. Most of the map was done during that
                          period, but more time was needed to re-do a couple areas and rework some progression, as well as
                          complete detailing and thing placement. Funny that I get ~90% of this done in 3 days, then spend
                          the next 4 months procrastinating on getting the rest done.

Additional Credits to   : Jimmy for starting Joy Of Mapping, jazz mickle for AQUATEX, the 32in24 team for some additional
                          resources, Fuzzball for the key sprites, Dragonfly for some additional texture edits, Fusion
                          Faktor for the modules, and everyone who provided me with feedback on getting this complete!
