* General information *

* For a long time I've been interested in a feature that existed for a few
versions of Doom Legacy and then vanished. The feature was translucent water
that warped the view through the water giving a more convincing effect than
is usually seen in Doom. There was also a demo map that showcased the feature.
As demo maps often are, it was a simple affair with no real gameplay.

There was a minor fault with the map so I fixed it up so that I could record a
video of it (link above) but then I got to thinking "what if I made the map
worth playing properly". I started working on it but after a while, the limits
of such an old version of Legacy and some rendering bugs with the feature that
I was specifically editing for (the water effect) started to make things creak
around the edges so I cut my losses and jumped ship to GZDoom and an
approximation of the water effect using 3D floors. Once I'd made the move to
GZDoom, my lack of restraint meant that it was no longer going to be an
almost-vanilla (except for the water effect) map.

* Jumping and crouching?  Sure, why not?  There shouldn't be anything that needs
either of these features.  Jumping may make a few areas a bit easier to reach
and ducking may save your skin at some point but nothing should be inaccessible
if you don't jump or duck.
