Description             : It's absolutely necessary to enable the OpenGL,
                          it's very desirable to include the dinamic lights
                          (well, some settings to them, so that they do not
                          shine through the walls, and that looks bad) and
                          Bloom, Sector Light Mode: Doom (if it's too dark,
                          it's better to correct the contrast), jumps and
                          squats are mandatory, tested in GZDoom 3.2.0, IWAD:
                          DOOM2.WAD
                          In earlier versions of the GZDoom wad will not
                          start, and in later versions it will not work
                          correctly.
