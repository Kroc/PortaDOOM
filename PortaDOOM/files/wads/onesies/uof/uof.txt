Misc. Author Info       : Jumping and crouching are not allowed (in fact, they
                          should already be disabled via MAPINFO).  No rocket
                          jumping on purpose, either.  I do recommend  binding
                          "swim up", however.

                          This requires GZDoom's hardware renderer with dynamic
                          lighting and 3D models enabled.  Enabling bloom is
                          encouraged, but not necessary.  Shadowmaps
                          (gl_light_shadowmap) can be used as well, but there's
                          some visual artifacts in some places with them
                          enabled.

                          **ALWAYS LOAD LIGHTS.PK3 AND BRIGHTMAPS.PK3 ALONG WITH
                          THIS ADDON**  These files come with GZDoom.  Failure
                          to do so will result in the levels not looking right,
                          or being unplayable due to being too dark.

                          Mouselook is considered a requirement.

                          The dmflags and dmflags2 CVars should both be set to 0

Description             : A man is on vacation and is out enjoying a day of
                          hunting while his wife and infant son are at home.
                          After a long and boring day, he starts walking back to
                          his car, only to discover a ravine that wasn't there
                          before.  Feeling an unusually strong urge to find out
                          what lurks beyond the ravine, he jumps down into it
                          and heads out into the dark, foggy forest night.

Additional Credits to   : The Elementalism team for their feedback, with a
                          special shout out to Bauul for his playtesting.
                          Realm667 for their repositories, my wife for helping
                          me with the story text.

                          Additional credits are listed below since they're

* Additional Changes from Vanilla Doom, and Things That Aren't Bugs *

- The chaingun has been replaced with an MP40 for aesthetic reasons.

- The chaingunners no longer drop a chaingun.  This is because of the new MP40.
  They now drop a few ammo magazines.

- Some monsters are more aggressive than their stock Doom varieties

- The shotgun's pellet pattern has been changed so that it's "tighter" and no
  longer in a flat line.
