Description             : Entropy is a large and challenging Boom compatible
                          (cl9) slaughter map with a gold and orange theme.
                          There are two main routes to take from the start,
                          one for plasma and the other for rockets, both must
                          be completed in order to finish the map, so your
                          decision wont leave you without one weapon. There
                          are 3 new keycards that replace the skull keys,
                          each of which will require you to beat a difficult
                          encounter to get. Once you have all 3 you can get
                          the BFG and will be rewarded with something...else.
                          The map has been completed without BFG and without
                          secrets to ensure it is balanced. Many of the
                          fights will require some puzzling out before you
                          can complete them. Sometimes this means simply
                          pushing a switch when you otherwise wouldn't and
                          other times it can mean something else entirely.
                          
                          This is a long and difficult map, but the other
                          difficulties have been balanced in the hopes that
                          people will use them. I would highly recommend that
                          people play this map in a GL port like GLBoom or
                          GZDoom as there are a few spots where software
                          struggles FPS-wise. The map is still playable in
                          Prboom-Plus but can get jittery in some of the more
                          open areas.
                          
                          Here is a rough guide:
                          
                          UV - I like challenging slaughter maps and enjoy
                          being punished for my mistakes and having to learn
                          from them. I like figuring out strategies to
                          complete fights. 
                          
                          HMP - I like challenging slaughter maps but I still
                          want to feel in control when I play.
                          
                          HNTR - I prefer run and gun gameplay with the odd
                          slaughter encounter thrown in. I still enjoy a
                          challenge now and then.
                          
                          Most fights are beatable in a variety of different
                          ways, so try stuff out! Remember to look for
                          secrets!
