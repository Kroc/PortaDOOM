Author's notes: There are no difficulties in THE GIVEN so it doesn't matter
what you "choose" on the difficulty screen with the scroll. If you get lost
or don't know what to do, look for the red torches. There's six puzzles
around the map that you'll need to complete in order to unlock the bridge
to the center. Keep in mind that you shouldn't need to "guess" the solution
to any of them. If you *still* feel lost, perhaps the symbol before the 
bridge will point you in the right directions...

I'm sorry in advance to how slow this will play on some computers!
