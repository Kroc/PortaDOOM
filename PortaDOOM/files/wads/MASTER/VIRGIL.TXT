Description		: VIRGIL'S LEAD is the 3rd Canto in my INFERNO 
			  series.  In your search for Beatrice, you lost your
			  guide Virgil (the beatnik space-poet) while crossing 
			  Acheron. But you've caught up with him again,
			  and he's agreed to lead you through the current way- 
			  station (mostly because demons and undead sergeants
			  are not much impressed with Virgil's way with words).
			    "You can get a lot further with a kind word and
			  a gun then you can a kind word."
			    "You belong to the NRA, don't you?" Virgil asks.
			    "No, I'm just a pessimistic pacifist."


			  This is a deceptively small level, but you'll need to
			  conserve ammo and try not to get shot or chewed on
			  too much, since the stim packs are in scarce supply.
