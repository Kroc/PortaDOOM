Description             : Extreme planning went into the play flow on this
                          level.  The archeticture is designed around a 
                          large castle with guard towers that hold each
                          access key.  The level is extremtly non-linear
                          to allow for the player to choose a varied path
                          each time.  Ammo and Health is placed in 
                          key positions, not enough to be wasteful, but
                          more than enough to finish the level from
                          a pistol start.
