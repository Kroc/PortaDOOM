Description		: NESSUS is the 5th Canto in my INFERNO 
			  series.  Minos decided to grant leniency and
			  not kill you until next week.  In the meantime,
			  having slipped past Cerberus, the top dog, you
			  and Virgil come to a precipice overlooking the river
			  Phlegethon.  There, Virgil greets the Minotaur
			  using phrases from an out-of-date "Passport 
			  to Demonese" by Charles Berlitz. Enraged at having
			  been asked to remove his panties, the Minotaur
			  falls upon the ground and throws a conniption fit.
			  You grab Virgil and climb down some boulders to
			  the foot of the cliff where Chiron, the chief 
			  Centaur, offers to have Nessus carry you across
			  the river on his shoulders.
			    "Why, that's mighty white of ya'," says Virgil.
			    "No problem, sailor," says Nessus. "Hop on."
			    
			  This is primarily a deathmatch level, but it's full
			  of enough surprises to make single play quite
			  challenging.
