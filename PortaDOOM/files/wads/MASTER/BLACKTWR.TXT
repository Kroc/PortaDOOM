File                    :"blacktwr.wad"  
Author                  : Sverre Andre Kvernmo ("Cranium" in the arena!)
Setting                 : Ok, here's the plot: Kick Butt!
			Gripping, isn't it? In case you are a little more 
			into story-lines you can keep reading.
			This and the other of my wads were to be released
			inside a 32-level "episode" on the internet. But 
			having id release them is about 666 times cooler. 
			The plot in the intended episode was as follows:
			You once were the biggest and baddest Cyber-demon to
			rule hell and you spear-headed the council that 
			governed the underworld; "the Cabal". Betrayed by the
			other members you find yourself not only dismantled, 
			but also a victim of the utmost demonic humiliation:
			You've been morphed into a human! Of course you're
			out for revenge and have to kick the other members of 
			the Cabal's butts one by one.
			
			In "Black Tower" you're nearing the end of your
			journey. You and Chagrin, the ruler of the Black
			Tower, came off the same conveyor belt as newly 
			assembled cyber-demons a few thousand years back. 
			"Oil runs thicker than blood" the two of you used to 
			say. Demons don't come much closer to friendship than 
			what you and Chagrin shared. Well now your buddy 
			rules the hordes of hell previously under your 
			command and have left you for dead. Your task is 
			simple: Enter the dreaded Black Tower, the nucleus of 
			black magic and the occult in all of Hell, get to 
			its highest floor and slay Chagrin. Then there is the 
			getting back out as well...

Credits                 : The whole of id Software for DOOM & DOOM II.
			Andrew (& Mark) Cornes, Gregory "Acoma" Hyne, 
			Peter "Pete" Ripley, David "Macca" Mccandless, 
			Bj›rnar Johansen, Baard Zachariassen and 
			Stian Danielsen for playtesting, viewpoints, 
			help, enthusiasm and for being mad bastards. 
			Oh, and Erling Paulsen for managing to convince me
			that there was such a thing as a full fledged 
			Doom-editor, back in early 94. Os!
			A brand new BFG goes out to Geoff Allan (DOOMed), 
			Raphael Quinet (DEU), Olivier Montanuy (DeuTex) and 
			Colin Reed (BSP) plus whoever put together idBSP. 
			Shawn Green for including me in the project.
			Last but never least to all other WAD-designers who 
			have lost themselves in the worlds of tag numbers, 
			upper textures and vertexes as badly as me, 
			particularily the other designers that worked on this 
			add-on. Looking forwards to play your wads dudes!
Deathmatch 
bad-arse credits:        Macca, Hunter, Woah, Loki and Pete. You can walk over
			my melted bodies anytime. Don't hang around that 
			corner for too long though. I'll silently BFG your 
			butt!

* Play Information *

# of Levels             : One, but three other wads in this pack was created 
			by me also. They are: 
			Bloodsea Keep                   (Bloodsea.wad)
			Mephisto's Maosoleum            (mephisto.wad)
			The Express Elevator to Hell    (teeth.wad)
Level Replaced          : Map 25


* Construction *

Base                    : An obsessive personality, lotsa caffeine and lotsa 
			nicotine.:Q A twisted mind doesn't hurt either.
			An additional credit should go out to those wad-
			designers that have inspired me greatly through their 
			work. I don't know all their names, but the names of
			their WADs should suffice. Hail the hall of fame:
			"Nukemine" (old I know, but the supreme numero uno 
			at it's hayday)
			"Castle of the Renegades". Best castle-type wad I've 
			seen.
			"Eternity"
			"Dante's Gate"
			The secret level in the AlienDoom episode was groovy 
			as well, and "Cleimos" had some nice touches.
Build Time              : Don't ask, really! First baby steps at "wadding" 
			taken in the summer of 94. Almost dropped out of 
			university for this bloody obsession. One reason for 
			surviving was that I handed in a wad of my campus as 
			one of my projects. <G>
			I would guess that I on average spend about 130 hours 
			on each wad. And it's not because I work slow :)
Editor(s) used          : DoomED 4, DEU2, BSP1.1, DeepBSP and idBSP.
Bugs                    : No way. Shawn has plucked them all out and forced 
			me to eat them. I hate you if you find some! ;)

			Hope you enjoy the wad.
