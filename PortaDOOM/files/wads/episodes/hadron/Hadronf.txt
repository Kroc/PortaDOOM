Story

A few days after the events of Concerned, another hero tries to breach the C.E.R.N facility, things have changed though, nukage is flooding everywhere including the surrounding mountains, things are really going downhill. The objective is simple, to try and halt the invasion by closing the portal discovered by our previous hero whos location and life signs remain unknown.........
It is all up to you.
=====================================================================================

Maplist

E1M1 - The breach
Music used - Suck this from Rise of the triad (Lee Jackson/Robert Prince)
This is pretty much the original but with the visuals and designed modernised for faster gameplay. 

E1M2 - Nukage disaster
Music used -  From blood
After some thought I decided to scrap the previous effort for this slot, so here is a 6 hour speedmap, though visually and gameplay wise it should be solid.

E1M3 - Toxic Treatment
Music used - Smoke and mirrors from Rise of the Triad by Lee Jackson/Robert Prince
The first half is redesigned off the original plan, again the layout is more open and hence more volatile. The second half is pretty similar to the original, except with cleaner visuals and some areas removed. Also a new method to obtain the secret blue key has been designed based on the new layout.

E1M4 - Withered Gardens.
Music used - Under Death by Mark Klem from Requiem Map08
The start is pretty similar, but the building contents and the level progression have been changed. I really like the result for this.

E1M5 - The IMP Crowd
Music used - Path of Destruction by Mark Klem
The start area has been completely opened up, the side wings whilst progressed in the same order have been completely redesigned. Also of course the visuals have been stamped in the computer/grey brick theme.

E1M6 - Gateway lab
Music used - Infinite by Tom Mustaine (TNT Map10/18)
This map was redesigned from scratch with a particular gimmick at hand. I won't go any further.

E1M7 - CB Reactor INC
Music Used - future military conquests by Lee Jackson (Duke Nukem 3D)
Apart from the start area, the rest is brand new with greater interconnectivity and height variation.

E1M8 - Collider control
Music used - Sign of Evil by Robert Prince (original track for this slot)
I made a proper start area this time. The main battled has been changed as well as the ending. Again no more things to tell.

E1M9 -  Prototype
Music Used - Descent (d cent06)
I remade the main playing area into something more modern, this map plays very very quick now which was the ultimate intention, as well as introducing the plasma gun of course.

*Update 03/01/2016
Gamebreaking bug fixed on E1M9 - Red key card was only present on UV only - This has been fixed.
Other bugs fixed 
- Blocking lines changed around the secret exit of E1M3 to prevent players getting stuck.
- On HNTR and HMP there was a stuck monster caused by an extra unneccessary monster being present. This monster was removed.
