Misc. Author Info       : I've played Doom on Amigas

Description             : An oldschool mapset for E1 of Ultimate Doom, in the combined E1/E2 style
                          of Fava Beans, but much more violent. Mapset is optimized for pistol start, 
                          though there are occasional goodies for continuous players. Every map exits
                          directly into the next, creating a single, giant facility. 

Story                   : You have received orders to investigate the giant UAC complex on Phobos.
                          Expect extreme enemy resistence from the moment you arrive. They are waiting
                          for you. You will find a new and powerful enemy caged in the final stage
                          of the first complex. Do not try to kill it. Instead, journey through
                          later stages of the vast, interconnected facility. We believe you can find
                          a way to attack it from behind, when you have stronger weapons. 


Special Notes for       : Note 1: Please do not kill the caged Cyberdemon in E1M1. The story of the   
Maxers and                mapset is that you will see it again in E1M8. 99% Kills means you have  
Speedrunners              maxed E1M1.
                          Note 2: In E1M4, you can look through a window and see a BFG on a tall 
                          column. You cannot reach that BFG in E1M4, it can only be accessed in a
                          secret area of E1M5. Yes, you are literally looking into E1M5 from E1M4.
                          There is also an inaccessible Medikit in that area.
