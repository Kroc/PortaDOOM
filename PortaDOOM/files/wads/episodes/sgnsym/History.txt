Shotgun Symphony:History

21 years in the making! ;)

Inspired by Knee Deep in The Dead and Fava Beans.

E1M1:A Lazy Day On Phobos
I started this map in Autumn of 1997. Shadowcasting was inspired by E1M7 of Jan van der Veken's Dawn Of The Dead.
Map was finished by winter of 1997. It's been cleaned up since then, but gameplay is almost unchanged, except 
for being harder at the end. Originally, the episode was supposed to end in the large open area you teleport to,
which means that E1M8 would take place there. After you killed the Barons, the outer walls would lower and you'd
have to face a Cyberdemon and a Spider Mastermind. Instead, I decided to shrink this area and use it as the central 
hub between several maps.

E1M2:Guts In A Blender
Started in Summer of 1997 as a Doom 2 map in the E1 style. Converted to Ultimate Doom in January of '98 and added
to this episode. Difficulty was recently spiked in a couple areas as a result of playtester comments.

E1M3:Bureau Of Bad Ideas
Started in winter of 1997 and finished by spring 1998. This is meant to be a trickier map in terms of secrets, 
including the secret exit. Fairly significant changes were made after dobu gabu maru and Demon Of The Well said
it didn't have enough action, with three areas receiving a difficulty spike.

E1M4:Have Some Fava Beans
Started sometime in 1998 but was only 45% complete when I stopped mapping in 2003. This was intended to be the 
most homagey map to Fava Beans, in this case, to E1M2. You'll see where. Map was finally finished sometime in 2013.

E1M5:Urban Sprawl
Started sometime in 1998. Because I love "Suspense" so much, this map was intended from the start to be gigantic,
so I could wander around in it a long time and enjoy the music. Map was 95% complete in 2000, and finally completed
in 2013. No one found the path to the BFG secret during testing. Hint: think of E1M7 of Fava Beans.

E1M6:Pumping Station Hoedown
Started in either 1998 or 1999, this map was about 40% complete in 2000. I simply ran out of ideas, until I thought
of making a ginormous pump room in 2011. I'm guessing it's the biggest pump room in Doom history. ;)

E1M7:This Is My Shotgun
First of the brand-new maps, this was done in December, 2013, and is so far the largest map I've completed in a 
single month. 

E1M8:Big Boss Blood Salad
Second of the new maps, this was completed in January-February of 2013. I was trying for a new, very nasty
wrinkle on the good old Baron slaughter. I also wanted it to be an actual, full map.

E1M9:The Miley Cyrus Concert
The final new map, this probably dates from March, 2013. It's a pretty tough crowd at the Miley Cyrus Concert. I'm
a Miley fan and I thought this would be a good place to send the Miley haterz for punishment. ;D
