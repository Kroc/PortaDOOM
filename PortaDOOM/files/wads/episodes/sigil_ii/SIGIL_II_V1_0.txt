Description             : Embark on a nostalgic nightmare: Immerse yourself in the dark,
			  demonic world of DOOM like never before. John Romero, the
			  original Icon of Sin, takes you on a terrifying journey to
			  commemorate the 30th anniversary of this legendary, first-person
			  shooter. SIGIL II is DOOM's unofficial sixth episode.

			  Upon breaching the pentagram of invulnerability in the final
			  moments of SIGIL, Episode Five, you find yourself not on a
			  victorious journey back to save Earth, but caught in Baphomet's
			  cunning snare, catapulted into a new, grotesque domain of
			  relentless torment, unending demon hordes, and an onslaught of
			  heavy metal mayhem!
