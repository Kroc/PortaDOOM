Description             : Legacy of Heroes is a Boom compatible episode for
                          Doom 2 with 11 levels. The maps use the textures
                          from Eternal Doom and the themes for the most are
                          fantasy oriented. The maps also feature a more
                          adventurous style and the level progression was
                          made to make feel the episode like a continuous
                          journey. Some levels are very long and all of
                          them were desgned with pistol starts in mind.
                          The last level has a custom dehacked boss.
                          This is the first wad I started to work on it, the
                          development started in March 2015 and ended in
                          October 2016 though works weren't continuous.

Story                   : Along with its experiments on the teleportation, 
                          the UAC on Earth started to make studies and
                          experiments on the time travel. One of the oldest
                          bases that was shut down and ready to be disbanded 
                          after being too unsuccessful for the researches
                          suddenly started to work on its own. A mysterious
                          force from the other side took control of the time
                          gate and from there it started a hellspawn invasion. 
                          Breaching into the infested base you are able to 
                          reach the time gate, but it can't be sealed from
                          there. The only thing you can do is to step
                          into the time gate...
