Description             : Preacher is a 9 map boom compatible episode. You play
                          as a mad preacher who hears a voice in his head 
                          impelling him to take down all evil in the World.
                          
                          Layouts are open and non linear, and start spots are
                          randomized.
					  
                          There are graphic and sound replacements, but weapon  
                          and enemy behaviours are untouched.
