Description             : A 10 level mapset for DooM II. This mapset was
                          inspired by the atmosphere of Playstation Doom and
                          Doom 64. It will feature the creepy ambient feel of
                          Playstation DooM/Doom 64 but maintain the core
                          gameplay of the PC version.

                          Best Played through GZDoom.

                          If you want the weapons to have their classic
                          behaviour (no Recoil, etc), load this with
                          c_weapons.wad

                          Special Thanks to Aubrey Hodges for allowing me
                          to use the Doom 64 Soundtrack for this mod.
