Description             : A 7 level mapset for DooM II, the sequel to
                          Innocence X2. This mapset was inspired by the
                          atmosphere of Playstation Doom and Doom 64. It will
                          feature the creepy ambient feel of Playstation
                          DooM/Doom 64 but maintain the core gameplay of the
                          PC version.

                          Best Played through GZDoom.

                          If you want the weapons to have their classic
                          behaviour (no Recoil, etc), load this with
                          c_weapons.wad

                          Special Thanks PRIMEVAL For Creating the
                          Soundtrack for this mod.
