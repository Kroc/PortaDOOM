Description             : A small mapset containing 11 thematically and visually diverse maps.
			  Bit challenging, but hope you have fun!

I would love to receive some hard spanking for whatever bugs, errors and mistakes in maps, as well 
as critique from gameplay/visual perspective. 
Maps should be Boom-compatible ( complv 9 ), but if issues arise, please notify me.
The conveyors unfortunately don't function properly on ZDaemon, so have that in mind.
1.01 - quick fixes
1.10 - alterations to maps 04 and 06.
