Description             : i like to keep my doom 2 installation floppies
                          attached to my computer with magnets so i don't
                          lose them
                          
                          some can experience seizures when exposed
                          to flashing lights or other visual stimuli.
                          even if you've never been diagnosed,
                          please be stop playing this wad if you encounter
                          disorientation, lightheadedness, altered vision,
                          involuntary twitching/jerking movements,
                          or momentary loss of awareness/consciousness.
                          i tried very hard to avoid
                          anything that would cause physical discomfort
                          but everyone is different
                          
                          this wad does not work with qz/gz/zandronum
                          as it relies on the old zdoom software renderer
                          and other quirks specific to zdoom (or zdoomLE).
                          you need 2.8.1 or newer
