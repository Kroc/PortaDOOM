Description             : Hell-Forged is a reboot of Demon Eclipse's Episode 
			  2. It no longer directly relates to the story in 
			  Doom 1, as the original project did. Instead it 
			  takes place on a different medieval human world 
			  where Hell has begun its invasion. It is, however, 
			  a sequel to DE-EP2, chronologically.

Additional Credits to   : Comet1337 & BlueShadow for their ZScripts.
