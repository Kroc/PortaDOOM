RUNNING SIGIL v1.21
Instructions for Windows and Mac OS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

First, important notes:

Hello, and welcome to SIGIL, the unofficial episode 5 mod.

SIGIL comes with these files:

SIGIL_instructions.txt
SIGIL_v1_21.wad
SIGIL_COMPAT_v1_21.wad

If you paid for the fan boxes (Beast Box or Big Box) then you also have these:

SIGIL_SHREDS.wad
SIGIL_SHREDS_COMPAT.wad

You need a version of DOOM to run SIGIL. If you are NOT experienced with the various
flavors of DOOM then you will not need to use the SIGIL_COMPAT_v1_21.wad and 
SIGIL_SHREDS_COMPAT.wad files.

To play SIGIL, you need the DOOM.WAD file from the original DOOM or from
The Ultimate DOOM. If one of these are installed, please note their location. 
You can get The Ultimate DOOM from Steam or GOG.com.

If you want the Buckethead music with the free WAD so you can play SIGIL with
Buckethead's absolutely incredible soundtrack, you can buy it 
here: https://www.romerogames.ie/si6il. 

If you are looking for the Buckethead MP3 soundtrack, you need to go
to Buckethead's site: https://music.bucketheadpikes.com/album/sigil-soundtrack

SIGIL merch is available here: https://www.romerogames.ie/shop

You can send any bugs you find to info@romerogames.com.

****
**** If you purchased SIGIL v1.0 and want to update it, you only need to download
**** the latest SIGIL_v1_21.ZIP and install it over your old version.

Why DOOM 1 and not DOOM 2?

SIGIL is a 25th anniversary celebration of the 1993 DOOM release. It was designed
to fit the design patterns and look of the original DOOM. I did not want to deviate
from the original much so this unofficial episode five uses the original tetxure
set for the levels, and adds a new sky like Thy Flesh Consumed did (epsidoe 4).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLING GZDOOM

Download GZDoom from https://zdoom.org. Scroll to the bottom 
of the page and click "Get ZDoom". On the next page, find the latest GZDoom and
click the download link that corresponds to your operating system under 
"Download (Modern, OpenGL 3.3 and higher)". Put GZDoom in its own directory.


WINDOWS ONLY: 

Copy your DOOM.WAD file into the GZDoom directory. Drag and drop SIGIL.wad and 
SIGIL_SHREDS.wad onto GZDoom.exe to run it. The order in which you select the files
is very important - select SIGIL.WAD first, then shift-click SIGIL_SHREDS.WAD, then
drag them both onto GZDoom.exe.


MAC OS ONLY: 

You will need to copy your DOOM.WAD file into a special directory
for GZDoom to find it. Run the Finder, bring up a New Finder Window, press
Shift-Command-G, type ~/Library and go to the "Application Support" directory, then the "gzdoom"
directory. Copy your DOOM.WAD file here.

1) Run GZDoom

2) Choose DOOM as the game

3) In the "Additional Parameters" section, click "Browse..." and choose the
SIGIL.wad file from the location where you installed SIGIL (hopefully the same
directory as GZDoom). If you bought a fan box, click "Browse..." again to 
choose the SIGIL_SHREDS.wad file.

4) Click OK


When you're in DOOM, select NEW GAME, the SIGIL episode, then the skill level.

If you want to listen to the MIDI music instead, only drag the SIGIL.WAD onto GZDoom.

Have fun!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

GOING ONLINE

The Doom community also provides a variety of options to play games online using 
client/server architecture ports. These services provide the work for you and host servers 
which you can easily join to play SIGIL. Depending on your preferences, you should pick one 
of the main online c/s ports:

Zandronum: https://zandronum.com/
Zdaemon: https://www.zdaemon.org/
Odamex: https://odamex.net/

To comfortably browse the offered servers, check one of the server browsers, most popularly:
Doomseeker: https://doomseeker.drdteam.org/ (warning, won't work with Zdaemon)
Doom Explorer: http://doomutils.ucoz.com/

Using a combination of these will allow you to search for and join other online players 
looking for aa game of SIGIL!

MULTIPLAYER COOPERATIVE MODE

DOOM is limited to 8-player multiplayer. I'll use GZDoom as an example: 

To run GZDoom in co-op, one person will be the host and the other players will 
connect to the host. Here are the instructions for running CO-OP MODE:


[[ WINDOWS PLAYERS ]]

To make it easier to run SIGIL and multiplayer mode in general, you should
use ZDL, a GZDoom launcher. Go here to get it: https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDL
You want the latest version 3-1.0. Put ZDL.exe in the GZDoom directory.

CO-OP HOST INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Find out what your IP address is. Run CMD.EXE. Then run ipconfig.exe and 
it'll show you the IP. It's usually 192.168.1.X. Tell the other players your IP.

2) Run ZDL.exe

3) Click the "General Settings" tab. On the left pane, click the + to add
a source port. Type GZDoom for the name, then click the ... and Select GZDoom.exe
from the directory where you installed it. In the right pane where it says
"IWADs", click the + and type DOOM, click the ... and select the DOOM.WAD
that's in the same directory as GZDoom.

4) In the "Launch Config" tab, in the left pane named "External Files" click
the + at the bottom and select the SIGIL.wad. Click + again and select the
SIGIL_SHREDS.wad. Then in the right pane, click on the
DOOM IWAD so it's highlighted.

5) Above the "Launch" button you'll see the "Skill" pull-down menu. Select 
the skill level.

6) To the left of the "Launch" button is a down triangle. Click it to expand it.

7) Select "Game Mode" as "Co-op"

8) Set the "Frag Limit". We usually use 20.

9) Select the number of players total with the "Players" pull-down menu.

10) You might want to save this setup with CTRL+S

11) Click the HOST button


OTHER CO-OP PLAYERS:

1) Run ZDL.exe

2) Do the same setup as the host numbers (3) and (4)

3) To the left of the "Launch" button is a down triangle. Click it to expand it.

4) Select "Game Mode" as "Co-op"

5) To the right of that field is the "Hostname/IP" field. Type the IP address of
the HOST in there.

6) Select the "Players" pull-down option "Joining"

7) On the right side click the "JOIN" button to start

----------------------

[[ MAC OS PLAYERS ]]

1) Find out what your IP address is. Go to System Preferences > Network and 
it'll show your IP. Tell the other players your IP address.

2) Run GZDoom.app

3) In the "Additional Parameters" box, go to the end and type:
-skill 4 -warp 5 1 -host X

X is the total number of players you want in the game. If it's just two of you, use 2.

4) Click OK. As other players connect to you, you will eventually see the game run.

CO-OP PLAYERS:

1) Run GZDoom.app

2) In the "Additional Parameters" box, go to the end and type:
-join X

X is the IP number of the host.

3) Click OK


Your game should start when all players have clicked OK.


--------------------------------------------------------------------

DEATHMATCH MODE

The setup is the same as the COOPERATIVE MODE setup for both HOST and the
other players, but the HOST needs to add some parameters to the
"Additional Parameters" box (MAC OS) or "Extra command line arguments" (WINDOWS):

-nomonsters -deathmatch

It does make things interesting when you leaves monsters in the game
and allow the deathmatch arenas to open into the single-player areas!

--------------------------------------------------------------------

EXITMATCH

I designed this game mode idea decades ago but never programmed it into
a game. It was invented for DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, Hexen, etc. Basically
any game with level progression where you can kill your buddies. It's 
most fun when there are 3 or 4 players.

The rules: You play COOPERATIVE mode as usual. You are all killing the
monsters to get to the exit. If you kill each other, that doesn't matter
since you end up at the start of the level anyway and have to catch up to
the other players.

But the only way to score the EXITMATCH point is to flip the exit switch.

There is only one point possible per level and that point goes to the player
who flips the exit switch! Watch as everyone starts the level cooperating,
but as soon as the end of the level is in sight, all kinds of problems
start happening.

Before you start, you decide how many levels, or points, are possible
in the match. That's how many levels you'll play, and the winner is the
player who flipped the exit switch the most times. You have to keep track 
of the score manually.

It's quite possibly the most fun I've had playing DOOM.

COMPATIBLE VERSIONS

There are some players who would like to use a more strict, old-school port
of DOOM like PRBOOM or CRISPY DOOM, or the Eternity Engine. If you
are using a version that is very strict, then load the SIGIL_COMPAT.wad and
the SIGIL_SHREDS_COMPAT.wad so SIGIL will work as an Episode 3 replacement.


I hope you enjoy SIGIL! If you want to drop me an email about it, I'm john@romero.com.
