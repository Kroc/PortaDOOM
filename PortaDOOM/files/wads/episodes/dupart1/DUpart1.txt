Description             : 6 map pack for GZdoom/Doom2.
                          
                          Small to Medium sized maps. Maps can be completed
                          rather quickly (just find the switch that opens the
                          exit and then find the exit), with lots of secrets,
                          switches, scripted events, and hidden areas full of
                          the stuff you might need to survive the next map.
                          HMP and UV difficulties available.
		
                          MOUSE LOOK REQUIRED. NO JUMPING/ CROUCHING. Intended for vanilla monsters 
                          and weapons but works well with most mods.
