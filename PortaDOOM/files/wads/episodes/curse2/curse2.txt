			If you only want to enjoy the maps and play resonably carelessly
			through the episode. I suggest one of the easier skill levels. 
			Skill 3 is made to be casual but still offer 
			something of a challenge.
			Skill 4 has been tested to be aggressive 
			and very challenging. (In other words. I died a lot while testing 
			these maps in this skill level).
			Skill 5 even more aggressive and challenging.
