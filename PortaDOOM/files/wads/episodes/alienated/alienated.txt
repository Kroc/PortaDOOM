Description             : Alienated is a 10-level wad made for GZDoom and
                          Zandronum. It features levels of varying size and
                          difficulty, all made with the Ancient Aliens
                          texture pack. There are 9 regular levels and one
                          secret map, accessible from map06.
                          
                           
                          
                          The wad is meant to be played with dynamic lights
                          turned on. Freelook is recommended, but not
                          required. No jumping or crouching. Do not use
                          vanilla or software in the sector light mode
                          settings, as these options can mess with certain
                          tricks used in map08 and ruin the experience for
                          you.

			  This 1.1 update contains updates to textures only.
