Misc. Author Info       : ***DO NOT JUMP***
                          ***DO NOT CROUCH***

                          Unbind jump and crouch before playing if you're used
                          to using them.  No rocket jumping on purpose, either.

                          **ALWAYS LOAD LIGHTS.PK3 AND BRIGHTMAPS.PK3 ALONG WITH
                          THIS ADDON**  These files come with GZDoom.  Failure
                          to do so will result in the levels not looking right,
                          or being unplayable due to being too dark.

                          Mouselook is required for the last map.

                          This is designed for -complevel 0

                          Please also ensure that you have dynamic lights, 3d
                          models, and high resolution textures enabled before
                          playing.  Bloom is also recommended, but not required.

                          Each map takes place in one of the Doomguy's dreams,
                          so you lose all your inventory and your health is
                          reset after each map.

                          One last thing, if you want to change levels, you'll
                          want to do so in the console.  Type "map corax##" to
                          go to that level; I didn't use the usual "MAP##"
                          format for the levels.

Description             : Hell was defeated by a lone marine.  But what no one
                          knew was that there was a far greater and nigh
                          inconceivable evil lurking beyond our realm: the Elder
                          Gods.  They saw how Hell had failed and felt it was
                          now their time to succeed.  They knew of the Doomguy's
                          strength, and decided to attack him in the one place
                          he's vulnerable: in his nightmares.

                          Shadows of The Nightmare Realm takes place within the
                          dreams of the Doomguy, each one manipulated by the
                          Elder Gods.
