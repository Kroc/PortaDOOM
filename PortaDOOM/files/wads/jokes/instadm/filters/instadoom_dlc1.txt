Description             : InstaDoom DLC Pack 1 has arrived! Is Instagram
                          too "mainstream" for your tastes? Do you need
                          filters -- er, I mean, "presets" -- that really
                          scream, "I am a hipster"? Do you not care about
                          usability? Then you'll love the new VSCO Cam DLC
                          pack!
                          
                          17 new filters (er, I mean, "presets") that
                          emulate each of the currently-free filt- uh,
                          presets in the VSCO Cam app! Most of them look
                          like garbage, but they are painfully hip! Sneer
                          at the basic bitches on Instagram with such
                          purposely-obtusely-named presets as A4, B5, M3,
                          and the ever-popular P5!!
