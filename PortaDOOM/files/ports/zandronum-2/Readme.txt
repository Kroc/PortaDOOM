 How to play online:

4. Click the "..." under "Path to executable". Set it to "C:\Program Files\Zandronum\zandronum.exe"
  - If you installed Zandronum in a different location, please use that location instead.
5. If you have your game files stored in another location other than the Zandronum folder, you can configure their locations under "File paths" in Doomseeker's configuration.

 Regarding backwards compatibility

As of Zandronum 1.0, we have discontinued the use of a particular resource file named skulltag_data.pk3. This, in turn, has broken compatibility with a multitude of Skulltag modifications, and also removes a lot of content that was deemed unusable when the project forked.

If you have created a modification that utilizes resources from this package, we do not encourage the further use of it and recommend updating with other resources or stock IWad data instead to ensure it is compatible with Zandronum.

If you wish to play modifications that were created for Skulltag that are not compatible with Zandronum, you can load the files skulltag_actors.pk3 (Included inside of the Zandronum folder) and skulltag_data.pk3 (You can retrieve this from an older Skulltag installation) alongside the modification in question.
