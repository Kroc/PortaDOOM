---------------------------------------------
What is Doom 64?
---------------------------------------------

Developed by Midway – San Diego, Doom 64 is a unofficial sequel to Doom II
developed for the Nintendo 64 and was released in March ’97.
Based on the Jaguar and Playstation code base, Doom 64 is considered
the most technically advanced Doom game of its time. In addition to
the completely revamped rendering engine, Doom 64 went through numerous
changes and improvements from that of Doom II. No graphics or sounds from
Doom II have been reused in Doom 64; instead, it features completely new
sprites, textures, levels and sounds and features a completely different
art style.

---------------------------------------------
What is Doom 64 EX?
---------------------------------------------

Doom 64 EX is a faithful recreation of the original game using the Doom source
code as the base with the benefit from newer control methods like mouse look,
high resolutions and color depth. In addition to that, Doom 64 EX will also feature
mod support to allow users to create custom levels, textures and sprites. Doom 64 EX
is also aimed to be 100% accurate to the original game as possible as well as
offering some PC-specific features that can enhance the game.

---------------------------------------------
What is Kex Engine?
---------------------------------------------

Kex is the codename for the engine that’s being used by Doom 64 EX. This is
a heavily modified Doom engine which will eventually be used as a base to
create original games and remakes of other classic console games that were
never ported to the PC

Installation
---------------------------------------------

In order to run Doom64 EX, an IWAD is required to play since it contains all the game
data and assets. This package does not include the IWAD and instead will need to
create an IWAD from a Doom64 ROM (also not included).

This package also contains a tool called WADGEN.EXE which will be used to generate the IWAD.

---------------------------------------------
Using WadGen
---------------------------------------------

Double click the application and a file dialog will open. Choose the Doom64 ROM and WadGen
will generate a wad file called DOOM64.WAD which will be the game's IWAD and will also
generate a file called DOOMSND.SF2.
Make both files are placed in the same directory as DOOM64.EXE
