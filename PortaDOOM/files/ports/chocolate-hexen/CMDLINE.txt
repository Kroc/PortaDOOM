                       mode. An optional letter of w or f appended to the

                      3=pig.  

  -connect <address>  Connect to a multiplayer server running on the given 
                      address.  

  -deathmatch         Start a deathmatch game.  

  -dup <n>            Reduce the resolution of the game by a factor of n, 
                      reducing the amount of network bandwidth needed.  

  -extratics <n>      Send n extra tics in every packet as insurance 
                      against dropped packets.  

  -ignoreversion      When running a netgame server, ignore version 
                      mismatches between the server and the client. Using 
                      this option may cause game desyncs to occur, or 
                      differences in protocol may mean the netgame will 
                      simply not function at all.  

  -newsync            Use new network client sync code rather than the 
                      classic sync code. This is currently disabled by 
                      default because it has some bugs.  

  -nodes <n>          Autostart the netgame when n nodes (clients) have 
                      joined the server.

                      instead of the default (2342).  

  -privateserver      When running a server, don't register with the 
                      global master server. Implies -server.  

  -randclass          In deathmatch mode, change a player's class each 
                      time the player respawns.  

  -server             Start a multiplayer server, listening for 
                      connections.  

  -servername <name>  When starting a network server, specify a name for 
                      the server.  

  -solo-net           Start the game playing as though in a netgame with a 
                      single player. This can also be used to play back 
                      single player netgame demos.  

  -timer <n>          For multiplayer games: exit each level after n 
                      minutes.

=== Dehacked and WAD merging ===

  -aa <files>        Equivalent to "-af <files> -as <files>".  

  -af <files>        Simulates the behavior of NWT's -af option, merging 
                     flats into the main IWAD directory. Multiple files 
                     may be specified.  

  -as <files>        Simulates the behavior of NWT's -as option, merging 
                     sprites into the main IWAD directory. Multiple files 
                     may be specified.  

  -deh <files>       Load the given dehacked patch(es)  

  -merge <files>     Simulates the behavior of deutex's -merge option, 
                     merging a PWAD into the main IWAD. Multiple files may 
                     be specified.  

  -nocheats          Ignore cheats in dehacked files.  

  -nwtmerge <files>  Simulates the behavior of NWT's -merge option. 
                     Multiple files may be specified.
