additional parameters are supported in addition to those present in the DOS
version.

=== General options ===

  -cdrom                       Save configuration data and savegames in 
                               c:\doomdata, allowing play from CD.

  -config <file>               Load main configuration from the specified

=== Compatibility ===

  -donut <x> <y>          Use the specified magic values when emulating 
                          behavior caused by memory overruns from 
                          improperly constructed donuts. In Vanilla Doom 
                          this can differ depending on the operating 
                          system. The default (if this option is not 
                          specified) is to emulate the behavior when 
                          running under Windows 98.  

  -gameversion <version>  Emulate a specific version of Doom. Valid values 
                          are "1.666", "1.7", "1.8", "1.9", "ultimate", 
                          "final", "final2", "hacx" and "chex".  

  -pack <pack>            Explicitly specify a Doom II "mission pack" to 
                          run as, instead of detecting it based on the 
                          filename. Valid values are: "doom2", "tnt" and 
                          "plutonia".  

  -setmem <version>       Specify DOS version to emulate for NULL pointer 
                          dereference emulation. Supported versions are: 
                          dos622, dos71, dosbox. The default is to emulate 
                          DOS 7.1 (Windows 98).  

  -spechit <n>            Use the specified magic value when emulating 
                          spechit overruns.  

  -statdump <filename>    Dump statistics information to the specified 
                          file on the levels that were played. The output 
                          from this option matches the output from 
                          statdump.exe (see ctrlapi.zip in the /idgames 
                          archive).

=== Demo options ===

  -maxdemo <size>   Specify the demo buffer size (KiB)  

  -playdemo <demo>  Play back the demo named demo.lmp.  

  -record <x>       Record a demo named x.lmp.  

  -strictdemos      When recording or playing back demos, disable any 
                    extensions of the vanilla demo format - record demos 
                    as vanilla would do, and play back demos as vanilla 
                    would do.  

  -timedemo <demo>  Play back the demo named demo.lmp, determining the 
                    framerate of the screen.

                      default because it has some bugs.

                      joined the server.
