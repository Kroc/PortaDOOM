3.0
---

*+	- Updated Zandronum's (G)ZDoom base to ZDoom 2.8pre-441-g458e1b1 / GZDoom 1.8.6. [Torr Samaho]
*!	- Rewrote support for preferred weapon order. Weapon info is now automatically looked up, the ORDERDEF lump has been removed. [Dusk]
*+	- Generalized the rune system. Any rune can be used as a powerup (including spread, prosperity and reflection, which are now available as powerups), and any powerup can be used as a rune. [Dusk]
*+	- Added a new buffer for the reliable packets scheduled to be sent from the server to the clients. This allows to limit the number of packets the server sends to a client per tick (CVAR sv_maxpacketspertick, default 64). In particular, this allows to spread the full update a client gets when connecting to the server over multiple ticks and should fix problems connecting to large maps with many actors. Also increased the packet loss buffer size from 1024 to 2048. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added NamedRequestScriptPuke, named variant of RequestScriptPuke. The two functions can now take 1-5 parameters, thus supporting 4 script arguments. [Dusk]
+	- Added ACS time and date access functions SystemTime(), GetTimeProperty and Strftime(). The return value of SystemTime() may be overridden by the user with the new CCMD acstime. [Dusk]
+	- Quad-buffered stereo / 3D Vision support can now be toggled with the new CVAR gl_quadbufferedstereo (default false). [Torr Samaho]
+	- The warp cheat now works online and can be used by spectators even if sv_cheats is false. [Dusk]
+	- Being banned from a server now shows the server's contact email address. Being masterbanned now shows a clearer message that directs to the forums. [Dusk]
+	- Players' positions in the join queue are now rendered on the scoreboard. [Dusk]
+	- The internal server browser now automatically loads the wads of the selected server when joining. For this, all wads need to be in a place where they can be found with the '-file' command line option. In the browser menu, the left and right keys allow to scroll through the list of filtered servers. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The 'Join the game' command key used by spectators is now customizable in the 'Customize Controls' menu. [Edward-san, Dusk]
+	- The default 'authhostname' CVAR has been changed to the official zandronum game authentication server ( auth.zandronum.com:16666 ). [AlexMax, Edward-san]
+	- BOTINFO now allows to define more than 128 bots. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Chat now features a movable cursor, allowing text insertion/deletion from elsewhere than just the end. [Dusk]
+	- Chat preview is now rendered on multiple lines, if necessary. [Dusk]
+	- Chat now remembers the ten previously sent messages that can be brought up with up/down arrow keys. [Dusk]
+	- Chat can now tab complete player names. [Dusk]
+	- Clients' account names are now visible in the output of CCMD "playerinfo", unless the player hides it with the new CVar cl_hideaccount. The server can always see the accountname from playerinfo. [Dusk]
+	- Added a mechanism to safe login credentials under Windows using the Windows Credential Manager aka Windows Vault. The credentials can be stored using the new CCMD 'login_add'. A default user name can be specified with the new CVAR 'login_default_user'. [Torr Samaho]
+	- This server now prevents players to use a name already used by another player. If a player requests a duplicate name, the player is renamed to 'Player N' where N is a random number from 0 to 9999. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD demo_pause that allows to pause/resume the currently played client side demo. In free spectate mode, the spectator can still move around while the demo is paused. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added cl_soundwhennotactive CVAR support to non-Windows clients. [Edward-san]
+	- Added support to clientside ACS_ExecuteWithResult with four arguments. [Edward-san]
+	- Added sv_survival_nomapresetondeath Zandronum dmflag to modify survival game mode where the map will not be reset on all players death - the players will be able to continue with fresh amount of lives. Dead players will carry over their inventory in accordance to "keep inventory" flags. [Zalewa]
+	- Backported ZDoom's ACS function GetActorFloorTexture. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The SQLite3 database can now be used in WAL mode. This mode is enabled / disabled with the new CCMDs 'db_enable_wal' / 'db_disable_wal'. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command SetDeadSpectator (int playernumber, int deadspectator). This command can turn alive players into dead spectators (deadspectator == 1) and revive dead spectators  (deadspectator == 0). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the new ACS command SetActivatorToPlayer as a replacement solution for AAPTR_PLAYERx that works with all 64 players instead of only 8. [Dusk]
+	- Added CVAR sv_forcerespawntime that controls the time delay before force respawn activates and respawns a player. [Ru5tK1ng]
+	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now allows Freedoom 0.11.3/Doom clients to join Doom/Freedoom 0.11.3 servers. [Torr Samaho]

!	- Clients don't error out anymore when encountering a division by zero in a DECORATE expression. Instead, a one time warning is printed on the first occasion and the result is assumed to be zero. This is necessary since clients can encounter this in valid DECORATE code due to Zandronum's jump handling. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed the dmflags values to match the ZDoom values to resolve compatibility problems with the updated ZDoom base and future ZDoom updates. Launchers and config files need to be updated to account for this change. [Torr Samaho] 
!	- sv_nodrop is now a dmflag. [Dusk]
!	- sv_limitnumvotes renamed to sv_votecooldown and changed to integer that determines the time to wait before a player can revote. All vote limits and times are double this value. [Ru5tK1ng]
!	- Merged sv_nokill and sv_disallowsuicide into one dmflag with two names. [Dusk]
!	- The CVARINFO error message triggered when an existing CVAR in the ini conflicts with CVARINFO now instructs the user to clean the ini. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The server now displays the IP address of the player upon connection and disconnection in log messages. [Dusk]

!	- con_virtualwidth and con_virtualheight now default to 640 and 480, respectively. [Dusk]
!	- kickfromgame and kickfromgame_idx have been renamed to forcespec and forcespec_idx, respectively, though the old names still exist for compatibility with e.g. aliases. Same also with the ACS function KickFromGame, whose new name is ForceToSpectate.
!	- A new non-fatal 'Script Error' message will be printed if in a MAPINFO episode definition it's present either 'botskillname' or 'botskillpicname' but not 'botepisode'.
!	- The CVARs gl_render_things, gl_render_walls, gl_render_flats and gl_mask_threshold are now restricted to beta builds. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Make newly connected clients wait before calling a vote. The wait time is controlled with the new CVAR 'sv_voteconnectwait'. [Ru5tK1ng]
!	- Keys can now be used while a client side demo is played. This allows binds to CCMDs like demo_pause to be used during playback. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Dead spectators will now preserve inventory so that they can be respawned with it. [Zalewa]
!	- When alive players complete the map in survival, dead spectators will recover their inventory on the next map in accordance to SV_COOP_LOSE* flags [Zalewa]
+	- The 'authhostname' DNS lookup is not done during startup anymore, but only if the IP address is needed. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The memory required for the bot nodes is now dynamically allocated when the first bot is added and freed when the last bot is removed. Thus, the CVAR sv_disallowbots is obsolete and was removed (adapted form Konar6's kpatch). This also fixes that offline, the memory required for the bot nodes was always allocated. [Torr Samaho]
!	- To stay compatible with Zandronum 2.x, GetCVar still returns the consoleplayer's value if called in a non-player activated CLIENTSIDE script to get the value of a user cvar. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Althud's discovered secret counter now shows global discovered secret count in netgames. [Zalewa]
!	- Changed the default value of sv_defaultdmflags to false. [Torr Samaho]

2.0
---

*+	- Updated Zandronum's (G)ZDoom base to ZDoom SVN revision 2560 / GZDoom SVN revision 900 [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added quad-buffered stereo / 3D Vision support to the GL renderer (minimal invasive implementation based on biospud's GZ3Doom). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the OS used to the version string the server sends to the launchers (adapted form Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
+	- When a banned client is prevented from connecting, the ban reason (if specified in the banlist) is logged to the server console (adapted form Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a new compatflags cvar: compat_silentwestspawns, emulates Vanilla compatibility by not performing any spawnfog/sounds for west angled spawns. [Water, Edward-san]
+	- Added compat_maxbloodscalar which will enforce vanilla red screen damage as if the blood_fade_scalar was 1.0. [Water]
+	- Ported CVARINFO lump support and the ACS functions SetCVar, GetCVarString and SetCVarString from ZDoom. This includes support for CVars that are automatically synced between server and clients. User CVars are not support for now though. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added domination and customteamgame to SBarInfo gamemode detection. [Blzut3]
+	- Added dmflag sv_unblockallies which is exactly like sv_unblockplayers except only unblocks ally players. [Dusk]
+	- The server can now advertise WADs as optional so long as said WADs are not necessary for clients to join. This is controlled with the new command-line option -optfile and the new preferoptionalwads CVar. Note: this is only a hint for server browsers! Authentication is and has always been lump-based and not WAD-based! [Dusk]
+	- Added support for Zandronum-specific gamemodes for the alternative HUD. [Dusk]
+	- Added CVAR sv_limitcommands which can be set to false to disable various flooding limits (allow constant suiciding, team changing, disable command flood auto-kick, etc). Should not be set to false in public servers. [Dusk]
+	- Added a Network Options menu which will contain all new network options. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now allows Freedoom 0.9/Doom clients to join Doom/Freedoom 0.9 servers. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Significantly bandwidth-optimized server-to-client ACS_Execute (and friends) calls. Such a call now uses 9 to 21 bytes of bandwidth per client per call (depending on the size of arguments), instead of 22 to 29 bytes. [Dusk]
+	- Added cl_showspawns, which creates a particle fountain at active spawns. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a decorate flag DONTIDENTIFYTARGET which prevents player identification from being done to the actor. [Water]
+	- Added CVAR compat_autoaim which restores vanilla autoaim, as there was a switch to autoaim filling in the gaps due to limited number of tracers from vanilla. [Water]
+	- Added CVAR cl_clientflags which controls both cl_unlagged and cl_respawnonfire to save bandwidth and make future booleans easier to transmit over the network. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a menu entry to for the GZDoom HUD, i.e. CVAR hud_althud. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a CVAR (wi_autoscreenshot) to allow screenshots to automatically be taken upon entering the intermission screen. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CVAR cl_clientsidepuffs which allows clients to predict puffs, which makes bullet puffs from hitscan weapons appear instantly. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added bloodsplatter effects to also be performed when cl_hitscandecalhack is set to true. [Water, Torr Samaho]
+	- The server now kicks its clients when it shuts down. [Dusk]
+	- Added support for RCON client tab-completion. This bumps the protocol version to 4, but clients using protocol 3 are still supported. [Dusk]
+	- The client movement buffer is now reordered based on the client's gametic information before the commands are processed. [Torr Samaho, Water] 
+	- Added gametic unlagged which should perform better under varying net conditions compared to ping-based unlagged. [Water, AlexMax, Torr Samaho]
+	- An icon will be displayed in the scoreboard if you're in the console, similarly to chat. [Cata]
+	- Added new player pawn property Player.MaxSkinSizeFactor which allows customization of the limits used by skin size checking. Skins larger than hitbox size (radius * 2, height) times this factor are downsized to fit. Defaults to the original hardcoded values 3.44, 1.68. Setting either value to 0 disables the limit entirely. Made the warning message more descriptive and informative. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed problems when boss monsters were replaced by Randomspawners in game modes that use map resets, e.g. survival. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Radius_Quake didn't work properly online if the duration was longer than 128 tics. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Blocked poly object doors were not handled properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: No longer can pick up team items in CTF or Skulltag after the round ends. [Water]
-	- Fixed: Monsters near the bottom of a ledge on a raising sector sometimes appeared as teleporting up on clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Light effects created by scripts weren't removed during a map reset. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: MAPINFO lumps were not protected. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Instant light fading was not updated on the client's side. [Water]
-	- Fixed: Frozen corpses were not properly cleaned up during the countdown phase, leading to unexpected behavior with player viewpoints. [Water, Torr Samaho]
-	- Trying to generate bot nodes on very large maps caused the game to crash. This should now be fixed at least on extremely large maps. Bots are disabled in this case. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The crouched sprite wasn't displayed for skins enforced through Weapon.PreferredSkin if the player class had +NOSKIN. [Esum, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Player spawn height now is on the ground so any player starts in the air will not result in team telefragging unless all spawns are full. [Water, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Missiles with the +NOEXPLODEFLOOR flag desynced online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: A voodoo doll exiting the level would print a bogus " exited the level" message. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Reflection desync between client and server if it doesn't have a Doom/Hexen bouncetype property. [Water, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a server crash related to the client movement buffer. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: SetFont() would 'leak' into other scripts online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Spectators could not trigger allowed action specials with sectors. The only exceptions are the 'Use' and the 'UseWall' action triggers. [Edward-san, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The server did not inform the clients fully about the crush behavior of floors, ceilings and pillars. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: The server could crash the clients with malicious packets. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed problems with the client side Z position prediction near ledges. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: a closing polyobject door made no sound online. [Dusk, Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: The server did not inform the clients correctly about the type of the door action, making the clients hear the wrong door sound. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: The client could potentially get HOMs while requesting a snapshot. [Leonard, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: CVAR sv_unblockplayers now works with different species. [Leonard]
-	- Fixed: The scale of skins enforced through Weapon.PreferredSkin was ignored if the player class had +NOSKIN. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In "teamgame" based game modes, friendly monsters didn't attack players of opposing teams unless provoked. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: If the packet with the end of a snapshot was dropped on a server with no active players, a client possibly waited forever for the snapshot to finish. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The client didn't let bouncing missiles spawned by A_SpawnItemEx pass through the player who spawned the missiles. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: After a map change, items at player starts would be inadvertently removed. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: CVAR cl_announcepickups didn't work in certain cases. [Leonard]
-	- Fixed: Custom attenuation values did not work online. [Dusk, Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Rotating polyobjects did not stop on map resets. [Dusk, Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Emulated multiplayer and multiplayer map changes broke random. [Torr Samaho, Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Since Skulltag 98a, chat and announcer stopped producing sounds in game during Time Freeze and in intermission after map exiting while Time Freeze was on. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Spectators could not use the 'Teleport_NoStop' action special. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Under certain circumstances, the SKININFO parser didn't properly handle the sprite entry. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The CCMD 'kickfromgame' and the ACS function 'KickFromGame' could not work offline. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Spawn() and friends did not sync the spawned actor(s)'s tid to clients. [Dusk]
!	- Renamed compatflags2 to zacompatflags and moved all Zandronum/Skulltag exclusive compatflags from compatflags to zacompatflags to resolve compatibility problems with ZDoom updates. Launchers and config files need to be updated to account for this change. [Torr Samaho] 
!	- Renamed dmflags3 to zadmflags, moved all Zandronum/Skulltag exclusive dmflags2 from dmflags2 to zadmflags and changed the remaining dmflags2 values to match the ZDoom values to resolve compatibility problems with future ZDoom updates. Launchers and config files need to be updated to account for this change. [Torr Samaho] 
!	- Since ZDoom 2.5.0 (and thus Zandronum) doesn't support script numbers higher than 999, Zandronum now gracefully errors out when encountering a script with an invalid number instead of crashing randomly. [Torr Samaho] 
!	- The Linux binaries can now be debugged with the zandronum.debug file, which is provided in a separated download. [Edward-san]
!	- Changed intermission proceeding to not rely on spectators if there is active players. [Water]
!	- The login server selected with authhostname needs to support version 2 of the login protocol. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed how a sentinel variable is handled which makes it much harder for clients to purposely drop packets, thus stopping a speed hack. [Water, Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed: Free spectators can now use the noclip cheat in demos. [Leonard]
!	- Changed the CTF flag height from 16 to 48, which will prevent players from clipping through them without picking them up on stairwells or uneven terrain. [Striker]
!	- Reduced the time interval between each join and each team switch to 3 seconds. [Edward-san]


1.3
---

*+	- Added persistent storage based on an SQLite3 database. The new CVAR databasefile controls where the database is saved (defaults to ":memory:", i.e. volatile in-memory database) and the new CVAR database_maxpagecount (defaults to 32768) controls the maximal allowed size in pages of the database. The new ACS functions
        void SetDBEntry ( string Namespace, string Key, int Value )
        int GetDBEntry ( string Namespace, string Key ),
        void SetDBEntryString ( string Namespace, string Key, string Value )
        string GetDBEntryString (string Namespace, string Key )
        void IncrementDBEntry ( string Namespace, string Key, int Increment )
        int SortDBEntries ( string Namespace, int Limit, int Offset, bool Descending )
        int CountDBResults ( int Handle )
        void FreeDBResults ( int Handle )
        string GetDBResultKeyString ( int Handle, Index )
        string GetDBResultValueString ( int Handle, Index )
        int GetDBResultValue ( int Handle, Index )
        int GetDBEntryRank ( string Namespace, string Key, bool Descending )
        void BeginDBTransaction ( )
        void EndDBTransaction ( )
        int GetDBEntries ( string Namespace )
      allow mods to access the underlying database. [Torr Samaho]
*+	- Added the Zandronum side of an optional account system based on authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol, AlexMax is working on the login server (https://github.com/AlexMax/charonauth).
		- The login server hostname can be specified with the new CVAR authhostname (masterhostname analog, port can be specified with ":port").
		- The new CCMD login allows a client to authenticate with the auth server the server has selected with its authhostname setting.
		- The new CVAR sv_forcelogintojoin (default false) can prevent unauthenticated players from joining the game (they can still connect as spectators).
		- The new ACS functions "int PlayerIsLoggedIn( int Player )" and "string GetPlayerAccountName ( int Player )" allow mods to obtain information about the account of a player.
	[Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag sv_sharekeys. When enabled, any keys picked are shared between players. Also, players joining the game get the keys others have as well. [Dusk]
+	- The ACS commands TakeInventory, SetActorProperty (only for speed and gravity) and SetAmmoCapacity don't cause network traffic unless they actually make a change to the affected actor. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The text scaling scaling mechanism (controlled by con_scaletext, con_virtualwidth and con_virtualheight) now can use the aspect ratio of the screen instead of 4:3. The new behavior can be activated using a new option in the text scaling menu or with the new CVAR con_scaletext_usescreenratio. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now allows Freedoom 0.8/Doom clients to join Doom/Freedoom 0.8 servers. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Added a client movement buffer. Instead of processing all movement commands of a client immediately, they are stored in this buffer now. Each tic per client up to two commands in this buffer are processed. This way, players with an instable connection shouldn't appear as teleporting instead of moving to players with a stable connection. Note: This only changes how a player perceives the movement of other players. It has not effect on how a player perceives his own movement. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- The mdk cheat command can now be used online in cheat servers. Unlike in ZDoom, it is also allowed in deathmatch modes. [Dusk]
+	- The noclip command for spectators is now client-sided for increased responsivity. [Dusk]
+	- Added new ACS command GetGamemodeState. The return values are GAMESTATE_UNSPECIFIED = -1, GAMESTATE_WAITFORPLAYERS = 0, GAMESTATE_COUNTDOWN = 1, GAMESTATE_INPROGRESS = 2 and GAMESTATE_INRESULTSEQUENCE = 3. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR sv_forcerandomclass. If this is true, all players use the random player class regardless of the class they selected. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Colored team names in exiting console messages and added extra console messages for CTF and Skulltag (scores, pickups, drops, etc.) (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added clientside CVAR cl_overrideplayercolors that overrides players' color translations. Allies will take the color of cl_allycolor and enemies the color of cl_enemycolor. These CVARs are white and black by default, respectively. cl_enemycolor is no-op when there are more than 2 teams, though cl_allycolor will still apply. [Dusk]
+	- Added new script type EVENT. By calling EVENT scripts the engine notifies a mod that a noteworthy event happened and also provides some information about the event using 'arg1' and 'arg2'. So far the following events are supported:
		GAMEEVENT_PLAYERFRAGS (player frags another player)
		GAMEEVENT_MEDALS (player receives a medal)
		GAMEEVENT_CAPTURES (player captures the flag/skull)
		GAMEEVENT_TOUCHES (player touches the flag/skull)
		GAMEEVENT_RETURNS (the flag/skull is returned)
		GAMEEVENT_ROUND_STARTS
		GAMEEVENT_ROUND_ENDS (the current round ends and the win sequence starts, e.g. when the fraglimit is hit)
		GAMEEVENT_ROUND_ABORTED  (the current round is ended prematurely, e.g. if all players leave the game)
	[Torr Samaho, Water] 
+	- Added new CCMD: listmusic, which will list all the currently loaded music. [Water]
-	- Added settings to fine tune the PWO behavior (CVARs pwo_switchonsameweight and pwo_switchonunknown). [Circunei Z]
+	- Added a new cvar: lobby, which applies lobby characteristics to a single map lump. In addition, if a map is set as a lobby map via the cvar, it is returned to after every other map. The lobby map is also returned to if the server is empty for more than 30 seconds. [AlexMax]
+	- Added an alias for the islobby MAPINFO tag: lobby. [AlexMax]
+	- Both types of lobby maps (MAPINFO and cvar) now ignore timelimits. [AlexMax]
+	- Added new ACS function RequestScriptPuke which requests execution of the given script on the server. The function must only be called from CLIENTSIDE scripts the script executed must be NET. [Dusk]
+	- Announcer sounds for pickups now can be disabled with the new CVAR cl_announcepickups (default true) (patch by dark-slayer-201). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the new vote type "forcespec" that forces a player to spectate. It can be disabled with the new CVAR sv_noforcespecvote (default false). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added a connect sound that is played when a player connects to the server as spectator. It can be disabled with the new CVAR cl_connectsound (default true). Kudos to Revilution for creating a sound for this. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Extended the vote kick protection for admins to include players logged into RCON (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The server didn't report when the master server notified the server that it's banned (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Blood actors (or anything else which do not use net IDs) within save games would crash the game upon loading. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Clients were not properly informed about the reset of moving non-door polyobjects during map resets. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Using SetAmmoCapacity on an ammo type a player didn't have online caused the clients to assume that the player now has a small amount of this ammo type. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The view was not centered in demos when the recording player released the mouse look button and lookspring was true. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Players sometimes could jump up through solid 3D floors online when unlagged was on. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_CrusaderRefire did not work properly online, causing the Crusader to desync. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Strife's Flamethrower did not shake the player's view online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: The server would crash with join passwords longer than 64 characters. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Skins defined with SKININFO didn't work properly if the sprite entry was not set explicitly. [Torr Samaho]
- 	- Fixed: Tampered clients could insert ASCII control characters into chat messages (e.g. line breaks) (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Strife's crossbow did not appear to use ammo on clients online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Clients using endgame while attempting to connect would not terminate the connection attempt. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Telefregging shouldn't count towards awarding the Fisting and Spam medals (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Toggle crouch shouldn't reset when menu is activated during a netgame. [Jam]
-	- Fixed: Monsters would become "blind" if the player who awoke them by sound became a spectator. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: When spawning more than 2 hellstaff rains in Heretic, the old ones would linger around on the client instead of disappearing. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: The linetarget cheat now prints the actor's actual health value. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: When a player turned into spectator the dynamic lights associated to the player's body were not removed. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: A_PoisonBagInit desyncs between the client and server. [Water]
-	- Fixed: Medals now show for who you are spectating instead of always your own. [Water]
-	- Fixed: The server possibly announced player disconnects for players that didn't fully connect. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player is damaged, don't send useless inconsistent values of HP and Armor (100/100) to the clients if they're not allowed to see the real HP/Armor. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: Line_SetBlocking didn't work properly online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: A_GiveInventory and A_GiveToTarget didn't work on CLIENTSIDEONLY actors. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: "botdebug_walktest 1" caused the game to crash when the player was looking through the eyes of a non-player actor. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: turn180 did not work as a spectator. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Gravity was applied twice in one tic when running off a cliff with compat_123b33jumpphysics enabled when it shouldn't be. [AlexMax]
-	- Fixed: Some ordinals weren't written correctly in the spectator queue message. [Esum]
-	- Fixed: Non-interacting actors like map spots would have their TIDs reset to 0 on map resets. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: The server didn't load the archived value of SERVERINFO CVARs (e.g. sv_smartaim). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The chat length limit of 128s was not enforced online. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: The server could erroneously show "FindStateLabelAndOffset" warnings. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: an opportune string could cause a buffer overflow while getting the address from a hostname. Thanks to kazzmir for reporting the vulnerability. [Edward-san]
-	- Fixed: +WEAPON.NOAUTOAIM did not disable horizontal autoaim with projectile weapons. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Monsters near the bottom of a ledge or fence sometimes appeared as teleporting up on clients online. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Changed huffman code from Hexen II's to that provided by Vortex Cortex. [Blzut3, Vortex Cortex]
!	- Changed the Offline Skirmish frag slider bar to go in intervals of 1 instead of 5. [Water]
!	- The CCMD playerinfo now distinguishes true spectators from in game players (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
!	- Botscript rand() renamed to random() and now returns a value between min and max inclusive instead of leaving max out of the possibilities. Now is actually random and now swaps min and max if min is greater than max instead of throwing a runtime error. [Dusk]
!	- Medals are only awarded when the game has started (is not in countdown). [Water]
!	- If the map rotation is not empty, the server now prevents map/changemap votes to maps that are not in the rotation, regardless of whether of sv_maprotation is true. This allows the server to restrict these votes without enforcing the rotation itself, which would also enforce the order in which the maps are played (adapted from an old patch of TIHan). [Torr Samaho]
!	- Renamed compat_123b33jumpphysics to compat_oldzdoomzmovement, which is a more accurate description of what the flag actually does. [AlexMax]
!	- The server now ignores client ping packets that don't make sense. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The team selection menu now is kept in sync with the local player's team, unless it was set to random. [Dusk]
!	- Changed the chat muting report: the server will inform the muted client how much time is left also in seconds. [Edward-san]


1.2.2
-----

-	- Fixed: The server reported to be using a testing build instead of a stable one. [Torr Samaho]


1.2.1
-----

-	- Fixed: A malformed packet could make the server kick the clients. Thanks to Konar6 for supplying a proof-of-concept exploit that allowed to debug the issue. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit with color codes in player names (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a client memory exhaustion vulnerability. Thanks to AgentME for reporting the vulnerability and submitting a preliminary patch. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a client heap corruption vulnerability. Thanks to AgentME for reporting the vulnerability and submitting a patch. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit based on out of bounds userinfo sent by a malicious client (ported from Konar6's kpatch). [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit based on improperly disconnected malicious clients. Kudos to kgsws for finding and reporting this exploit. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed an exploit that allowed malicious clients to create additional bodies. Kudos to kgsws for finding and reporting this exploit. [Torr Samaho] 
-	- Fixed: A malformed packet could crash the server. Thanks to AgentME for reporting the vulnerability and submitting a preliminary patch. [Torr Samaho] 
!	- The linux binaries are not compiled with -fno-stack-protector anymore. This was originally intended to increase compatibility with distros using older glibc versions but is not necessary anymore since the source is open. Thanks to AgentME for pointing this out. [Torr Samaho]


1.2
---

*+	- Revamped the authentication error messages: The server now reports which kind of authentication failed (i.e. protected lump or map) and reports a list of all loaded PWADs including their md5 checksums. The client also automatically logs the corresponding local values which should make it much easier to pinpoint the cause of an authentication error. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added compat_fullweaponlower to emulate vanilla without bundling it with another flag. [Water]
+	- Added new dmflag "no medals", controlled by the new CVAR sv_nomedals. If this is true, clients are enforced not to show medals, i.e. behave as if cl_medals == 0. [Torr Samaho] 
-	- Fixed crashes related to loading many announcers. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: +showscores did not always respond properly when viewing a demo. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Monsters near a ledge sometimes appeared as constantly falling down and teleporting back on clients online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Interpolation points and actor moves didn't work properly on clients after a map reset online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Client side demo recording could crash the client. [Circunei Z, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed a lastX/Y/Z desync between client and server. [Water]
-	- Fixed: Calling a map/changemap vote with an existing non-map lump as argument caused the server to throw an error. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When a player carrying the flag died or disconnected, the flag was spawned on the floor instead of the actual Z position of the player. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The commands "wait", "error", "error_fatal" and "crashout" can't be called by ConsoleCommand anymore. [Torr Samaho] 


1.1.1
-----

-	- Fixed: The messages sent with ay_team were visible to players of the other teams. [Dusk, Torr Samaho]


1.1
---

+	- The authentication mechanism for non-map related lumps now allows Freedoom 0.8-beta1/Doom clients to join Doom/Freedoom 0.8-beta1 servers. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Added a menu option for gl_use_models. [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Demos now use the lump authentication system to ensure that demos are played back with correct WADs. If demo authentication fails, an error message is printed with a list of needed WADs. New CVAR demo_pure controls this behavior. [Dusk]
+	- Added new compatflag "explosion thrust", controlled by the new CVAR compat_explosionthrust. If this is enabled, explosions cause a strong horizontal thrust like in old ZDoom versions. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added client side prediction for the line special ThrustThing and ThrustThingZ when the specials are called from linedefs or sector actions. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Improved the client side Z position prediction when passing from one sector into another. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Improved the client side position prediction when rocket jumping on bridge things. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "bridge drops", controlled by the new CVAR compat_bridgedrops If this is enabled, non-SOLID things like flags fall through bridges (as they used to do in old ZDoom versions). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Extended the launcher protocol to optionally report the value of the CVAR sv_enforcemasterbanlist. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Bots now recognize 3d midtextures and know to avoid ones that block their movement and can jump over 3d midtexture railings. [Dusk]
+	- Improved the alignment of the health/armor port of the new fullscreen HUD in case the health and armor icons have a different size. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The client connect options cl_startasspectator and cl_dontrestorefrags are now collected as flags in the new CVAR cl_connect_flags. [Torr Samaho]
+	- A player's country code (determined based on the player's IP) is shown on connect and in the output of the CCMD playerinfo, if a GeoIP.dat compatible with MaxMind's GeoIP library is in the directory of the server binary (or in /usr/share/GeoIP/ or /usr/local/share/GeoIP/ under Linux). The implementation is based on Konar6's kpatch. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Clients can prevent their country code from being shown to the other players with the new connect option CVAR cl_hidecountry (default false). [Torr Samaho]
+	- If a reason for a kick vote is given, this reason is now included in the ban reason (adapted form Konar6's kpatch). [Dusk, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the "afk2spec" system from Konar6's kpatch (controlled by the new CVAR sv_afk2spec that specifies the number of minutes a player has to be idle before being forced to spectate). Different from kpatch, players are warned before they are forced to spectate and dead spectators are not forced to spectate. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CVAR con_notifylines (allowed values range from 1 to 50) that allows users to set how many lines the notify field should extend to. [Dusk, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS commands GetPlayerLivesLeft and SetPlayerLivesLeft. In game modes using sv_maxlives, these commands allow to access and change how many times the specified player is still allowed to respawn. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command KickFromGame (int playernumber, str reason). This command forces the specified player to spectate and can only be used in an ACS script on a server. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added Circunei Z's patch that adds PWO support. It can be activated with "switchonpickup == 3" and configured using the weapon setup menu and the new ORDERDEF lump. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added NORANDOM support to A_CustomBulletAttack and A_FireBullets (ported from ZDoom revision 2318). [Torr Samaho] 
+	- Added new CVAR cl_connectiontype (default 1, allowed values 0-1). The lower the number, the less network traffic the server will try to send to the client. Currently this is very limited and only has one effect: With a setting of 1, blood sprites are spawned on the client with a size depending on the damage dealt, while they are always at full size if it's 0. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "ZDoom 1.23b33 jump physics ", controlled by the new CVAR compat_123b33jumpphysics. If this is enabled, jumping behaves more like it did in ZDoom 1.23b33. In particular, the MAP26 reverse window jump is not possible anymore. [Watermelon, Torr Samaho]
+	- The CCMD say_team now considers true spectators, i.e. non-dead spectators, to be a team in team based gamemodes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Hopefully fixed player class related Hexen startup crashes. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Newly connecting clients were not properly informed about a music change if the music name was longer than 15 characters. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: Attached 3d midtexture heights were not reset properly during map resets. [Dusk]
-	- Fixed: Clients appeared to get double ammo from weapons while playing demos. [Dusk, Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The server sent its revision number with short instead of long precision to the master. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: In single player with multi player emulation enabled a player couldn't change the player class by turning to a spectator and rejoining. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: The line special SendToCommunicator didn't work properly online. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed: When morphing a player, the server didn't inform the other clients about the ammo amount of the morphed player. [Torr Samaho]
-	- Fixed compatibility issues of skulltag_actors.pk3 with some Skulltag mods. [Torr Samaho]

-	- Use the crashcatcher.c from the latest ZDoom (r3071, r3089 (includes the i_main.cpp change since it's required), r3329, r3747, and r3928). This solves the forkbombing issue in the crash handler. [Blzut3]
-	- Fixed: When recording a client side demo the special client side commands (like weapon changes) were not recorded at the correct position of the demo stream but always after the currently processed server packet. [Torr Samaho]

!	- Changed the default of the CVARs cl_run and freelook to true. [Torr Samaho]
!	- To work around problems of Zandronum's state jump handling, clients now try to break infinite state loops of zero duration by not allowing any actor to go through more than 10000 states in one tic. [Torr Samaho]
!	- If the selected intermission pic (or WINERPIC/LOSERPIC in non-team game modes) doesn't exist, INTERPIC is used. [Torr Samaho]

1.0 (changes since Skulltag 98d)
--------------------------------

*+	- Added kgsws' software 3D floors patch. Kudos to him for making a patched based on GZDoom revision 323, that made it easy to apply it to Skulltag. Furthermore, 3D floors are available in competitive modes now. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the new experimental GAMEMODE lump that allows to configure Skulltag's built in gamemodes. Note: GAMEMODE is a protected lump, i.e. the GAMEMODE has to be identical on the server and the clients. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command ResetMap that does a map reset like done in survival or (T)LMS. This command only has an effect in gamemodes that have the MAPRESETS flag (can be set with the GAMEMODE lump). [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added live counter to the HUD for survival and survival invasion. As a prerequisite, the server now informs the clients about the lives each player has left. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added DesignatedTeam property which allows things to be assigned to teams for friendly fire calculations [Blzut3]
+	- Added basic client side prediction for "pushers", for instance used by Sector_SetWind. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new compatflag "old random generator", controlled by the new CVAR compat_oldrandom. If this is enabled, the original Doom random table is used to generate random integers in [0,255], which should make for instance the SSG cause a little more damage. [Torr Samaho]
+	- The compatflag compat_oldweaponswitch now also restores the weapon switch cancellation behavior from Vanilla Doom. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new CVAR cl_respawnonfire that allows the player to decide whether to respawn when pressing the fire key. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Removed NOGRAVITY from InvulnerabilitySphere, Soulsphere, Megasphere and BlurSphere and added the new compatflag "nogravity spheres", controlled by the new CVAR compat_nogravity_spheres. The compatflag gives these spheres the NOGRAVITY flag again, but only when they are spawned by the map. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added sv_maxlives support for lastmanstanding and teamlms. [Torr Samaho]
+	- General improvements to announcer code to allow for default announcer sounds. [Blzut3]
+	- Added AnnouncerSound(str entry, int flags) function to allow custom announcer events. [Blzut3]
+	- Considerably improved client side prediction when the player is standing/jumping/moving/landing on another actor, e.g. a bridge thing. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Considerably improved client side prediction after respawning and teleporting. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Clients can now control how often the server sends them updated player positions. The is done with the new CVAR cl_ticsperupdate (default value 3, allowed values 1-3). The lower the number, the smoother the movement of the other player appears on a client but the more network traffic is used by the position updates. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added Popsoap's dynamic light definition for the SuperShotgunGuy and the Hectebus. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Reworked how lightning generated by the MAPINFO property "lightning" and the line special ForceLightning is handled online. It is almost completely client side now (the server only needs to send a single command to the clients each time ForceLightning is called), thus it causes nearly no network traffic. The only downside is that the lightning effects are not synchronized between clients and server, i.e. the clients evaluate all random values on their own. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added an auto return system for the terminator sphere and the hellstone, configurable by the new CVAR sv_artifactreturntime (default 30). The terminator sphere/hellstone is moved to a random spawn spot sv_artifactreturntime seconds after it has been spawned (no matter if it was spawned normally at map start or after being dropped by a player). Setting sv_artifactreturntime to 0 disables auto return. This should finally make terminator and possession playable on all maps. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD motd which redisplays the message of the day. [Dusk]
+	- Added CCMD version_info which displays information about the Mercurial changeset the binary is based on. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD delmap which allows deleting maps from map rotation without clearing it first and CCMD delmap_idx, which allows deleting the map by index number shown by the maplist CCMD. [Dusk]
+	- Added CCMD insertmap for adding maps into the maplist at other positions than just at the end. [Dusk]
+	- Added: "snd_announcervolume" CVAR to adjust the announcer's volume and added an announcer volume adjustment in player setup under the announcer picker. [TIHan]
+	- Added new compatflag "don't stop player scripts on disconnect", controlled by the new CVAR compat_dont_stop_player_scripts_on_disconnect. If this is enabled, the ACS scripts with a player as activator are not terminated when this player disconnects. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new dmflag "unblock players", controlled by the new CVAR sv_unblockplayers. If this is true, player bodies are treated as if they had the THRUSPECIES flag and players don't telefrag other players anymore. [Torr Samaho, Dusk]
+	- Added ZDoom's timidity code since it's compatible with our open source license. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Since skulltag_data.pk3 is not auto loaded anymore, shareware IWADs are supported again. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Exported Hissy's turning behavior to a new codepointer, A_FaceConsolePlayer, which takes a TurnAngle parameter defaulting to 0. Hissy is no longer a native actor. [Dusk]
+	- Noticeably reduced monster bandwidth usage by letting the clients reuse the last updated actor positions. [TIHan, Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command PlayerIsSpectator that returns 1 if the player is a true spectator, 2 if the player is a dead spectator and 0 otherwise. It also returns 0 if the specified player does not exist. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added CCMD demo_skiptics that allows you to skip a specified amount of tics. For instance, "demo_skiptics 35" skips a second and "demo_skiptics 2100" skips a minute. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command ConsolePlayerNumber that returns the number of the local player. Returns -1 if called on the server. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added the possibility to leave the join queue with the spectate command. [Torr Samaho]
+	- Added new ACS command GetTeamProperty that returns various team-based information. [Dusk]
+	- Added new CVAR cl_spectatormove which can be used to control the speed of movement while spectating. [Dusk]

!	- Players aren't forced to spectate after a "changemap" map change on a server with a join password anymore. [Torr Samaho]

!	- If a client isn't allowed to know the health and armor of another player due to the gamemode, health and armor of this player are not displayed in coop info anymore. Furthermore, the mugshot of these players through coop spy is displayed as if the player had full health. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The server now logs RCON connects to the console. It already logged RCON disconnects, so it should log connects, too. [Torr Samaho]
!	- The CVAR chase_dist now can't be made smaller than 0 anymore. [Torr Samaho]
!	- When a client disconnects from a server, sv_gravity on the client is reset to its default value, discarding the value the server told the client to use before. [Torr Samaho]

!	- The "sv_cheats must be true to enable this command." message is not displayed more than once per second on a client online anymore. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Being killed by a teammate doesn't count towards "You Fail It" or YSINE medals anymore, making it consistent with excellent/incredible medals that ignore team kills. [Torr Samaho]

!	- Converted the ACS function GetTeamScore to be compatible with ZDaemon's version of this function. [Torr Samaho]
!	- Raised the maximum number of players from 32 to 64. sv_maxclients and sv_maxplayers still default to 32 to stay compatible with existing mods. [Torr Samaho]
!	- When a spectator enters the game its associated scripts are stopped. Previously the scripts just were disassociated, causing them to continue running even after the player disconnects. The old behavior can be restored with compat_dont_stop_player_scripts_on_disconnect. [Torr Samaho]
