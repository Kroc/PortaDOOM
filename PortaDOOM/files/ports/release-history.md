GZDoom 3.4.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Wed Jun 06, 2018 5:24 pm*

Highlights

* enable `#include` support in "modeldef" files
* removed DirectDraw and Direct3D backends, removed un-accelerated SDL framebuffer backend
* reorganization of 2D and 3D rendering code in preparation for Vulkan in the future, performance improvements on newer hardware
* CVAR that handles it is now `vid_rendermode` - `vid_renderer`, `swtruecolor`, and `r_polyrender` have been removed and combined into new CVAR
* added a `lightsizefactor` command to gldefs.
* allow animated title pics
* Add support for Unreal Engine 1 vertex mesh format
* added LevelLocals vec2/3Offset(Z) functions for portal-aware offsetting without needing actors
* Add `OnGiveSecret` virtual function on `Actor` for customizing behavior of secret finding
* `BLOCKASPLAYER` flag: treat non-player actors as blockable by "block players" lines
* added 'revealed on automap' linedef flag, UDMF only
* added forced automap style to linedef, UDMF only
* Added startup song definition for custom IWADs
* This release contains a major render optimization for highly detailed maps that may give a +20% performance improvement on Intel and AMD hardware (less on NVidia because the driver has far less overhead that could be optimized away)

Important note:

This version of GZDoom is running a survey to let us developers know a little bit about the hardware that GZDoom is being run on. It is completely anonymous and will only send 3 points of data:

* operating system
* number of CPU cores
* renderer being used, including the generation of graphics hardware

All 3 points do not contain anything explicit, but only some rough categorization of the information. (e.g. we cannot see what graphics card you own or what specific CPU you have.)

We would like to ask as many users as possible to allow sending this data. The more users participate, the better we can decide where to put our focus in future development.
More detailed information can be found here.

GZDoom 3.2.3 Released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Dec 03, 2017 11:14 am*

This is an additional point release to address some issues with the 3.2.2 point release and add even more features. Due to the way this release was handled, the change log will include 3.2.2's changes as well.

Notable features since 3.2.1:

* new timer code, GZDoom now appears a lot smoother in interpolated frames
* more bugfixes, including some for non-Windows platforms
* improve speed for ARMv7 processors by setting tuning options to the Cortex-a7 CPU (for Raspberry Pi 2)
* Several ZScript extensions and fixes
* Improved OpenGL profile selection on Linux
* Rather than giving version info, GZDoom now displays the name of the game you are currently playing in the window title. This can be disabled via `i_friendlywindowtitle`
* Implemented unicode handling in some functions
* improved handling of temporary files on timidity++
* added latch keyword to CVARINFO
* new grenade and ice shard sprites, removed non-GPL copyrighted assets

More-complete changelog since 3.2.1:

* let the 3 relevant text functions handle UTF-8 strings

  These functions are: `DCanvas::DrawTextCommon`, `V_BreakLines` and `FFont::StringWidth`.

  This will allow strings from UTF-8 encoded assets to display properly, but also handle the OpenAL device name on international systems, as this will be returned as an UTF-8 string.

  Due to backwards compatibility needs the decoding function is rather lax to allow both UTF-8 and ISO 8859-1 to pass through correctly - and this also implies that it will allow mixed encodings which may happen if strings from different sources get concatenated.

* sanitization of temporary file stuff for Timidity++.
  * do not use the global temp directory. Instead create one in the AppData folder.
  * removed lots of unneeded code from tmpfileplus.
  * use C++ strings in there.
* fixed potential memory leak in `M_VerifyPNG`.
* Fixed incomplete ACS string pool state after loading of saved game
* Added `static` to `CreateCeiling` (base.txt)
* Fix 'Requested invalid render buffer sizes' when executing the reverbedit command from fullscreen
* fixed upscaled fuzz drawing in swrenderer
* UMAPINFO parser, including some convenience additions to `FScanner`.
* fix shader targets being case sensitive
* `i_friendlywindowtitle` cvar: Show name of the game instead of GZDoom's version/last commit data
* Fixed applying of brightmaps to overridden textures
* Fixed detection of the first entry from internal IWADINFO
* fixed: high uptime was causing overloads in `uint32_t` and float structures (float losing loss of precision) - this caused any computer online for more than a few days to experience jankiness with internal animations such as rotations and shader timers. Unfortunately, this sounds the death knell for 32-bit platforms, since `uint64_t` is now required in time-critical structures, which will hurt performance tremendeously, but 64-bit systems will be unaffected.
* exported `P_Thing_Warp` to ZScript.
* Inside the renderer, use only the time value being passed to `RenderView`.
* get the timer used for animation only once at the very beginning of the frame and pass it on to the renderer to avoid any dependencies on the timer's implementation.
* Exposed `String.Remove()` function to ZScript
* Upgrade timer code to use nanosecond accuracy internally
* Fixed return state of player entered event
* Switch to C++11 steady clock, and Remove the platform specific timer implementations
* add doom e1m6 to `rebuildnodes` list.

* Improved OpenGL profile selection in SDL backend
* Extended `LineAttack()` with offsets and new flags
* Place the HUD model correctly in the world so that shader light calculations work
* Removed unused parameter from several functions in `FStateDefinitions` class
* Fix wrong math for model/light distance check
* Added runtime check for negative array indices in VM
* Added implicit scope for `if`/`else`, `while` and `do`/`while` statements in ZScript.
* Scope is added only for variable or constant definition so it will no longer leak to outer scope
* Added string representation of 'static const' token - No more 'Unknown(-141)' in 'Expecting ...' error message
* Extended `String.LastIndexOf()` with `endIndex` parameter
* de-init `DoomStartupInfo` on 'restart' ccmd so that the window title always contains the correct game information.

* Added ZScript functions `GetBool()` and `SetBool()` to CVar class
* Fixed non-portable usage of `__solaris__` preprocessor definition
* Added ability to get texture name from script

GZDoom 3.2.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Dec 03, 2017 12:11 am*

Notable features:

* new timer code, GZDoom now appears a lot smoother in interpolated frames
* more bugfixes, including some for non-Windows platforms
* improve speed for ARMv7 processors by setting tuning options to the Cortex-a7 CPU (for Raspberry Pi 2)
* Several ZScript extensions and fixes
* Improved OpenGL profile selection on Linux
* Rather than giving version info, GZDoom now displays the name of the game you are currently playing in the window title. This can be disabled via `i_friendlywindowtitle`

More complete changelog:

* add new ice shards for frozen actors exploding (without hexen), removed zd_extra version
* new grenade sprites
* added 'classicflight' user cvar which allows players to move forward laterally rather than according to their pitch. (Works like Heretic/Hexen/Duke3D/etc)
* fixed out of bound read in zip file loader
* added ability to get texture name from script
* fix non-portable usage of `__solaris__` preprocessor definition
* added zscript functions `GetBool()` and `SetBool()` to CVar class
* Made dynamic array's `Find()` and `Max()` functions constant
* improve speed for ARMv7 processors by setting tuning options to the Cortex-a7 CPU (for Raspberry Pi 2)
* exposed string split functionality to ZScript
* added `Wads.FindLump()` to zscript
* added `Wads.ReadLump()` to zscript
* Added `Wads.CheckNumForFullName()` to ZScript
* Extended `String.LastIndexOf()` with `endIndex` parameter (zscript)
* Added implicit scope for `if`/`else`, `while` and `do`/`while` statements in ZScript
* Scope is added only for variable or constant definition so it will no longer leak to outer scope
* Added runtime check for negative array indices in VM
* Extended `LineAttack()` with offsets and new flags
* Improved OpenGL profile selection in SDL backend
* fixed: put limits on `A_SoundVolume`
* added latching CVARs to CVARINFO
* game timer now uses performance counters and only calculates values once per frame
* force rebuild nodes for doom e1m6 - fixes a clipping issue with a certain door closed
* fixed return state of player entered event
* exported `P_Thing_Warp` to ZScript
* put in timer resets in the shader system to reduce the effects of running GZDoom too long and the timers losing precision
* also reset shader timers when a new level is started
* Fixed detection of the first entry from internal IWADINFO
* Fixed applying of brightmaps to overridden textures
* fixed: Made shader targets not case sensitive
* fixed bad use of `FScanner::GetNumber` and `GetFloat` in code inherited from ZDoomGL. This could lead to bad error messages if some malformed definitions were used.
* Rather than giving version info, GZDoom now displays the name of the game you are currently playing in the window title. This can be disabled via `i_friendlywindowtitle`

GZDoom 3.2.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Oct 22, 2017 3:26 pm*

The main reason for this release is because texture uniforms were uploaded to shaders incorrectly in 3.2.0. However, the rest of master was just bugfixes and minor improvements, so it was merged for this release. (I got permission from Graf to do this release)

Changes from 3.2.0:

* Fixed applying of height argument in `A_Fire()` function
* Removed all code needed to support macOS earlier than 10.7 Lion
* Fixed crash on attempt to register IDs for undefined class
* added `vid_cropaspect`. This cvar turns `vid_aspect` into a letterboxing function that will crop the unused sides of the screen away, instead of stretching it. Requires one of the non-legacy OpenGL framebuffers to work.
* remove `vid_tft` and `vid_nowidescreen` and associated menu option. Their functionality was supersceded and extended by `vid_aspect==3` (which has the same effect as setting both to true anyhow), and it was mostly just redundant.
* Fixed: don't interpolate view movements if a key press didn't result in any changes.
* If *nix, add default gzdoom.pk3 directory to `File.Search` paths
* fixed: inverted color order for post-process textures to BGRA to correctly match the internal texture standard in GZDoom
* added ability to change slider color using mapinfo's gameinfo
* added 'startuptype' to `iwadinfo`, allowing to change the game startup screen with custom iwads
* Fixed applying of compatibility settings for IWADs
* Fixed a few cases when IWAD was checked by hardcoded index
* Fixed arch-vile bleeding when damaging target

GZDoom 3.2.0 Released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Oct 03, 2017 11:52 pm*

Major release highlights:

* zd_extra.pk3 splits off copyright infringing assets, allowing game makers to delete this file and distribute a fully GPL-conforming copy of GZDoom without further changes.
* Custom IWAD support
* Video render scaling (play in 320x200, or any custom resolution)
* Custom screen shader support
* MENUDEF replacements are now merged, allowing GZDoom to easily present new menu features in older mods that include one
* Tons of fixes and improvements

Changes from 3.1.0:

    Merged with QZDoom 2.0.0
    "Software" light mode (in OpenGL) now supports radial fog setting
    Unsloped Flats can now use non-power-2 textures in software mode
    Menus now merge in with a mod's custom MENUDEF when it provides menu replacements. This is due to older mods' menus becoming very quickly outdated.
    Rise of the Wool Ball is now supported as an IWAD
    Custom IWAD support is now available. A custom IWAD file must have the extension ipk3/iwad, and contain a "iwadinfo" lump similar to GZDoom.pk3's with only this IWAD's information and no file list.
    "Classic Transparency" option - turn off ZDoom's additive transparency effects for the original game resources.
    Better non-accelerated buffer support for software rendering - when vid_hw2d is disabled or otherwise using an unaccelerated framebuffer, stencils and on-screen objects now show up better.
    (Windows only) vid_used3d is now renamed to vid_glswfb. This matches the same CVAR that is available on Mac/Linux.
    vid_glswfb is now exposed to the menu.
    r_visibility now affects GL's Software lightmode as well as Softpoly.
    Player Sprite overlays now support the PSPF_MIRROR flag which flips the sprite horizontally across the entire screen.
    Menu Blurring option - when running in OpenGL mode, a mod can now blur the screen when the menu is active.
    Unfriendly players - when a PlayerPawn object has -FRIENDLY set, they become a playable monster and interact with the game world as one. Additionally, they become deathmatch opponents, capable of dealing and taking damage from other players.
    Custom Screen Shaders - mods are now able to include their own post processing shaders, insertable before the bloom pass ("beforebloom"), before 2D objects are drawn ("scene"), and after everything is on the screen ("screen").
    vid_saturation saturates/desaturates the screen - improves the appearance of the screen when using certain brightness/gamma settings as well as allowing the user to play in 'black and white' (similar to the display control panel option). (Requires post-processing shaders to be active and hardware gamma must be disabled)

Changes since QZDoom 2.0.0:

    r_visibility now works in OpenGL (software lightmode only) and SoftPoly
    (Software only) Added r_line/sprite_distance_cull cvar that culls lines or sprites beyond the specified distance
    (OpenGL only) Added 'enabled' property for post-process shaders, to automatically enable them without the assistance of ZScript
    Enable Core Profile on macOS only when OpenGL 3.3 is available
    Use multiple threads for xBRZ upscaling
    Added new "sv_damagefactor*" variables.
        sv_damagefactorplayer: Scales damage for player
        sv_damagefactorfriendly: Scales damage for all other +FRIENDLY objects
        sv_damagefactormobj: Scales damage for everything else (incl. monsters and decorations)
    added per-class think time profiling tool.
    Fixed crash when drawing untranslated font
    Fixed applying of color to untranslated fonts in hardware renderer
    added 'kill baddies' cheat - does the same thing as 'kill monsters' only it ignores friendly monsters
    changed gl_ssao_portals default to 1
    (OpenGL hardware/software framebuffer only) Revamped vid_max_* variables. Originally debug variables, they've been redesigned to allow screen resizing based on aesthetics.
        The variable controlling the entire system is now vid_scalemode:
            0 == neighbor scaling, controlled by vid_scalefactor
            1 == linear scaling, controlled by vid_scalefactor
            2 == 320x200, neighbor scaled
            3 == 640x400, neighbor scaled
            4 == 1280x800, linear scaled
        vid_scalefactor added for modes 0 and 1, which changes the render resolution to any arbitrary amount the user specifies >0, and resizes the screen to that amount. Valid values are >0 to <=2.0, where values above 1.0 are super-sampled to the screen (allowing up to SSAAx4 super-resolution). Please note that due to the way this is implemented, screenshots generated using this system will be in their original render resolution, so a super-sampled screenshot will actually come out in higher resolution.
        menu options for this system have been added
        please note that this system is not available in the DirectDraw/Direct3D software framebuffers. For those, ZDoom's old -2 and -4 command-line parameters still work. (For now)
    post-process GLDefs parsing is more strict than QZDoom's, and will error out if invalid keywords are used.
    Lemon parser now uses dynamic stack size comparable to C++'s, allowing deeper nesting of if, for, and while loops in ZScript
    fix dynamic light clamping in true-color software renderer
    BSP node cache will now no longer write to NTFS alternate streams. In Linux/Mac systems, this means said filenames will no longer contain a colon.
    The classic software renderer now supports use of the 'maxviewpitch' CVar - it still cannot pan to a full 90 degrees, though (sorry folks) ;)
    (Source code) Some OpenBSD support is now in the source. Please note that this is currently HUGELY unsupported by the dev team and comes as a user contribution. (From our perspective: 'here be dragons, tread ye carefully')
    Models now have normals in the hardware renderer, allowing them to be affected by dynamic lights and SSAO
    sv_singleplayerrespawn changed from a 'latching' cvar to a 'cheat' cvar using the new cheat cvar system. This means the cvar can now be enabled dynamically for single player games, however, it is still disabled when cheats are.
    added render visibility flags - will selectively make objects disappear on the screen when certain rendering feature criteria is not met. The goal of this is to allow two different objects to appear on the screen based on renderer type, as a deterministic-supporting substitution for the oft-requested "moar reliable vid_renderer checks plzplz" - this feature is also intentionally designed to be future proof (i.e. if you use this feature MODS WON'T BREAK when new features are introduced in the associated renderers!).
    added 'r_showcaps' ccmd to show which render flags are currently active in the renderer
    maximized window state is now saved between sessions as well as when 'swtruecolor' is changed
    Support binding textures for custom PP shaders
    added per-level exit texts independent of the current cluster.
        This is mainly to support UMAPINFO which does not have clusters but has been extended to define separate exit texts for each target map that can be reached from a given map.
        Special names 'normal' and 'secret' can be used to define texts specific to the default exits.

        New MAPINFO properties:

            exittext = mapname, "text"...
            textmusic = mapname, "musicname", order
            textflat = mapname, flatname
            textpic = mapname, picname

        textflat and textpic are like 'flat' and 'pic' for clusters, one defines a tiled background, the other a fullscreen image.
        Setting an empty exittext will disable a cluster-based text screen that may apply to the given map.
    timidity++ fixes for Linux
    Significantly improve shadowmap light performance for faces with a large number of lights but where only a few applies to each individual fragment
    More classic IWAD compatibility fixes for missing textures
    Fixed unset inflictor in WorldThingDamaged event
    removed tag 0 check for 3D floors because as seems to be par for course in Doom modding, some people actually exploited this bug.
    handle state label resolution in a non-actor context more gracefully.
    addressed incorrect ACS printbold implementation: For native Hexen maps it will now be correct, but all others will have to set a flag in MAPINFO's 'gameinfo' section to avoid problems with numerous ZDoom maps depending on the incorrect implementation.
    Reset interpolation coordinates for all actors before the current thinking turn instead of at the start of each actor's own Tick function so that indirect actor movement gets properly interpolated.
    fixed: The color for untranslated font was missing its alpha channel.
    print a warning if a decal definition cannot find an animator. This is important because DECALDEF cannot tentatively find animators declared after the decal.
    let PlayerPawn.ForwardThrust use its angle parameter.
    fixed: a destination-less line portal should be ignored by the sight checking code.
    added a user reserved range of statnums from 70-90
    fixed: FastProjectile's movement code was missing a portal check.
    softpoly now uses a zbuffer, similar to hardware rendering
    Add sprite adjustment to softpoly
    Fixed camera rotation from FraggleScript
    Fixed crash when morph item is used from ACS
    Fixed incorrect damage flags' checks for A_Kill...() functions
    more softpoly fixes
    softpoly now supports sloped 3d floors
    Fixed handling of default arguments in Actor.GiveSecret()
    In software rendering, lights now check if they are too far above or below a certain plane before rendering. An example of this is in unloved.pk3 where in map02, some lights are above the ceiling.
    Fixed VM abort with null activator for SecretTrigger object
    fixed: changing 'uiscale' did not always update the screen size properly.
    Game will now print the version at the start of the log.
    Properly handle VM abort exception when occurred in menu
    Add GOG path for Doom 3: BFG Edition
    fixed: When offsetting the projectile for testing, P_CheckMissileSpawn must also reset the projectile's sector to its new location.
    fixed: When stepping through a sector portal and touching a two sided line on the opposite side, its opening must be used, regardless of the FFCF_NOFLOOR flag.
    fixed: The struct field compiler did not check for forward declared type references that hadn't been resolved yet.
    Added per-actor camera FOV.
    Player FOV changes are now transmitted over the network using floats.
    Fixed Infinity and NaN floating point values formatting as string
    (8-bit software) Fixed overflow for precise blend mode
    Added Actor.A_SoundVolume(int slot, double volume) function to ZScript
    Fixed crash caused by script number collision of ACS typed scripts
    fixed: Do not call DoEffect when predicting player movement.
    fixed crash when defining a global constant which references a class member constant in its value.
    fixed: For original Hexen, executing a death special should not clear it. This addresses the bell in HexDD's Badlands being rung before it is ready to use. This also removes the redundant special handling in the ZBell actor.
    gzdoom.pk3 has now been GPL-ized and has had many assets replaced with free GPL-conforming assets.
    zd_extra.pk3 is now included in the GZDoom distribution. This file contains the assets replaced in gzdoom.pk3 to their original assets, with the exception of the MBF German Shepherd, which now uses Nash's dog sprite replacement. If you are creating a commercial game, you may now simply remove zd_extra.pk3 to avoid copyright issues.
    Static executable assets now replaced as well. The Doom marine is now completely gone, the crash logger now shows a dying marine from FreeDoom, instead. GZDoom sports its own logo icon.
    Unsafe math operations removed from armv8 - they were deterministic breaking and broke original monster behavior.
    added: m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show when inputting text, even when using a mouse
    shadowmap quality is now exposed to the menu
    OpenGL 3.0 is now allowed for software OpenGL framebuffer (aka vid_glswfb) - The Mesa rendering library supports this just fine, and it seems it runs without trouble on known troublesome 3.0 cards.
    OpenGL 3.3 is now required for the modern rendering path for hardware rendering. This means that ALL OpenGL cards prior to this version will revert to the legacy rendering path; no longer using shaders or clip planes. This was done due to there being too many compatibility issues and bugs with cards and drivers from this era.
    fixed playersprite calculations in softpoly
    classic software renderer now supports 'pixelratio' mapinfo definition - allowing mappers to now create square pixel maps in all 3 renderers.
    softpoly now supports dynamic lights in truecolor mode
    Updated "cream" and "olive" definitions in TEXTCOLO to be more readable
    Added four text colors: ice, fire, sapphire, teal
    added TID to 'actorlist' and similar console commands output
    Fixed read beyond buffer boundary during font color parsing
    Fix speed of sound and unit scale
    Fixed bugs with Line_PortalSetTarget and added more portal geometry warnings
        fixed: A bug exists where portals that have been deactivated with Line_PortalSetTarget cannot be reactivated, even if given a valid target.
        fixed: Another bug exists where portals that were created in an inactive state (using a target line tag of 0) could never be activated. (Even with the above bugfix.)
        Linked portals that have been demoted to teleport portals because they do not have a return portal now emit a warning.
        Portals that are supposed to be traversable, but do not have back-sector now demote to visual portals and emit a warning, because nothing could ever possibly traverse them anyway.
    Fixed flags when demoting interactive portals
        Interactive portals demoted to visual due to not having a back-sector would not have their interactive flag properly cleared.

QZDoom 2.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Mon Jul 10, 2017 5:13 pm*

The main purpose of this release is to standardise and make available to modders the custom screen shader system. However, it comes with it a lot of updates, mostly from GZDoom since its latest release:

Updates/fixes:

    Updated to GZDoom 3.1.0, plus some fixes after.
    (from GZDoom) "Software" light mode (in OpenGL) now supports radial fog setting
    (from GZDoom) Unsloped Flats can now use non-power-2 textures in software mode

GZDoom 3.1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Wed May 31, 2017 11:31 am*

Although this is mainly a bugfix release there are a few notable new features

    support of Strife Veteran Edition's extended single player campaign
    better handling of stereo sounds.
    PlayerThink code has been exported to scripting.
    On Windows and macOS the system's MIDI synth is no longer the default. Instead, FluidSynth and a small soundfont are now included to provide better default playback quality.

Notable bugfixes:

    translucency on weapon sprites works properly
    some layout fixes with SBARINFO based status bars.
    fixed par time display on level summary screen.
    fixed loop tag checks for Ogg files.

GZDoom 3.0.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Mon May 01, 2017 10:34 pm*

This is a bugfix release which addresses the following:

* potential crash when changing the render output in-game and continue playing
* crash in the software renderer with camera textures
* for 32 bit Windows libsndfile.dll is reverted to the old version due to some incompatibility with the newer one
* cleanup of dynamic light options

GZDoom 3.0.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Apr 29, 2017 6:26 pm*

This is the first version that merges all software rendering features from QZDoom.
In addition this is the first release under the GPL v3.
To comply with the GPL, FModEx had to be removed as a sound backend, so this version will only support OpenAL.

New features aside from merging with QZDoom include:

    scriptable status bars.
    scriptable level status screens.
    static constant arrays in classes.
    support for Doom64-style lighting in the software renderer, with the exception of gradients.
    optimization of the scripting VM by removing some always active debug support.

Please note that starting with this version the 32 bit Windows version will require support for SSE2, because the true color software renderer cannot work without it. As a result it can no longer be used on Pentium 3's and older.

GZDoom 2.4.0 / QZDoom 1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Mar 19, 2017 10:14 pm*

GZDoom 2.4.0 and QZDoom 1.3.0 have been released. This is the first official ZDoom.org release for both source ports.

GZDoom 2.4.0:

New render features:

    Doom64-style color properties for sectors (i.e. different color settings for floor, ceiling, walls and sprites.)

New scripting features:

    script versioning to account for syntax differences between versions.
    fully scripted inventory system.
    fully scripted menu system.
    scripted event system.
    printf-style string formatting function for ZScript.
    dynamic arrays for ZScript.
    more access to map data from ZScript.
    user definable actor properties.
    separation of scripts into UI and Play parts to have better access control
    exported obituary code to ZScript to allow more flexibility when handling special cases.
    SectorTagIterator and LineIDIterator classes to search for tags.

Other:

    added GetActorFloorTexture and GetActorFloorTerrain ACS functions.
    added new PRINTNAME_ constants for retrieving next and secret next level in ACS.
    per-sector settable fog density.
    fixed handling of sector action things with special trigger semantics.
    true color fonts can be defined in FONTDEFS.
    added a BOUNCE_NotOnShootables flag to address an old design bug in the bouncing system.
    added StealthAlpha actor property for defining a minimum visibility value of a stealth monster.

    and many more smaller additions and fixes.

QZDoom 1.3.0:

    Updated to GZDoom 2.4.0
    LLVM dependency completely removed
    Dynamic Lights almost fully implemented in software renderer
    Shadowmaps for OpenGL

ZDoom 2.8.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Mon Feb 22, 2016 11:34 pm*

ZDoom 2.8.1 has been released. This is primarily a bugfix version over version 2.8.0 with some small additions:

    #region/#endregion is now supported for text lumps. ZDoom doesn't do anything with them but ignore them, but this allows editors to treat them however they like.
    Better localizability of the menus.
    Terrain definitions can now be optional.
    Walking into an area with a reverb effect no longer mutes all sound.
    Heretic's time bomb artifacts now spawn in the proper locations.
    Heretic's powered firemace balls once again seek their targets.
    The whirlwind attack used by Heretic's Ironlich sometimes fizzled out immediately.
    Instant sector movement actions are again instant.
    Various other minor fixes.

GZDoom 2.3.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Jan 07, 2017 15:36*

This is a bugfix release. Fixes include:

- Dehacked strings were cut off at the end
- corrected a few cases where dynamic lights were not correctly set up
- default lights for Doom and Heretic are now properly attenuated.
- fixed a few issues with the ZScript compiler
- fixed potential crash with Doom's boss brain
- fixed state validation problem with Dehacked modifications.
- fixed a crash with multiplayer games
- fixed a few more cases where player sprites became momentarily visible during a portal transition.
- made particle translucency calculations more precise

GZDoom 2.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Jan 01, 2017 15:17*

It's time to celebrate the new year with a new release. Here's 2.3.0.

New features include

    First version with official ZScript support.
    Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) for the OpenGL renderer, written by dpJudas
    UDMF-configurable fog density per sector
    Glowing flats settable through UDMF
    Proper rendering processing of large actors
    Improved IWAD picker, allowing to choose the active renderer, or autoloading lights and brightmaps.
    Proper dynamic light definitions for Freedoom.
    Multithreaded software rendering
    Some improvements to the console
    Fixed the pitch issues that were warned about for 2.2.0.

GZDoom 2.2.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Sep 18, 2016 23:18*

A new version is available. This one merges the legacy support back into the mainline so there is no corresponding 1.x version anymore.

New features:

    Fully functioning Line and Sector Portals
    Roll Sprites
    Flat Sprites
    Sprites Facing Camera
    Bloom
    Multisampling
    Stereo 3D VR
    Quad Stereo
    Tonemap Setting
    Lens Distortion Effect
    DECORATE Anonymous Functions
    Lots of new ZDoom development features

GZDoom 2.1.1 and 1.9.1 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Feb 23, 2016 12:12*

These releases coincide with ZDoom 2.8.1 and bring the same fixes. In addition 2.1.1 also fixes the broken fake contrast feature in 2.1.0.

2.1.1 will be the first official release that also comes as a 64 bit version

GZDoom 2.1.0 and 1.9.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Feb 06, 2016 9:01*

Here's the new versions that coincide with ZDoom 2.8.0. Actually, these have one bug less that was fixed shortly after the ZDoom release.

GZDoom 2.0.05 and 1.8.10 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Dec 21, 2014 15:29*

A new release is available!

2.0.04 fixes most of the issues in 2.0.03 and updates to the latest ZDoom, of course.

I also decided to make another update to the 1.8 branch because 1.8.07 contained at least one serious crash bug with polyobjects.

GZDoom 2.0.03 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Sep 16, 2014 8:37*

The first non-beta release of GZDoom 2.0 is available.

2.0 is a major overhaul of the rendering system, aimed at cleaning the code base from many of the workarounds needed for non-shader-supporting hardware. It also aims at optimizing things a bit better for modern graphics hardware.

Performance improvements for GL 4.x supporting hardware can be up to 10% (NVidia) or 5%(Intel, AMD) (The high difference is due to far more efficient draw call performance by NVidia drivers, which is 20x higher than on AMD.)
The minimum requirement for this version is OpenGL 3.0, so it should run on all modern hardware, including Intel GMA, but please note that this has not been tested on Intel GMA 3000 so I cannot guarantee that this GPU chipset actually works, as its drivers may lack a few features GZDoom takes for granted. Feedback regarding this issue is appreciated.

There are only a few new features here, the main goal with this version was to create a foundation for future improvements, but the most notable is that the dynamic lighting system is now entirely based on shaders - the old multi-layer-texturing method to apply dynamic lights no longer exists. This should bring some visual improvement for hardware which couldn't support this method with GZDoom 1.x.

GZDoom 1.8.7 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Sep 16, 2014 8:24*

This is the final update for GZDoom 1.x, bringing it to the latest state of ZDoom.

This release is done for the sole reason that GZDoom 2.x requires OpenGL 3.0 support, so that users of older hardware (which should slowly disappear from the market) have one last chance to get the latest ZDoom features.

Future development will continue in v 2.x only.

GZDoom 2.0.02 Third beta release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Aug 19, 2014 17:32*

A new beta of GZDoom 2.0 is available.

This restores support for OpenGL 3.3. A workaround has been added to enable the lighting code with the reduced feature set of the older hardware.

This means that all AMD and NVidia cards that are capable of running GL 3.x are supported again.
Intel GMA 3000 won't work, though, because it never received a GL 3.3 driver. This chipset would run into problems with the new shader code anyway.

This build has been tested on NVidia hardware and on Intel GMA 4000. What I still need is feedback from AMD users, both with older and newer hardware, before I can do an official 2.0 release.

I need the following info:

* are there any visual issues, in particular with dynamic lights?
* how is performance compared to 1.8.6, both with lights on and off?

GZDoom 2.0.01 Second beta release
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Aug 03, 2014 8:43*

The first beta release of the new renderer is available now. Please note that this is a beta release, intended for finding bugs. It should be stable on Geforce cards but no guarantees.

A few notes about compatibility:

This release uses very recent OpenGL 4.4 features, most importantly persistently mapped buffers. This means that the minimum requirements are either a working OpenGL 4.4 driver or support of the GL_ARB_buffer_storage extension. As of this writing this extension is supported by the most recent drivers of NVidia, AMD and Intel for their OpenGL 4.x supporting hardware. If you got hardware that supports GL 4.x but GZDoom shows an error that this extension is missing, please update your driver.

Also, as of this writing there seems to be no driver for Windows XP, supporting this extension, so the binary was compiled without Windows XP support. This will change if I find out that such a driver has been released - but I consider that unlikely.

So why no compatibility handling? The answer to that is that any working attempt of doing this would utterly defeat the intent of the rewrite. All my tests have shown that the only other way to get the data to the GPU fast enough in this particular scenario is (what irony!), to use immediate mode functionality. The classic buffer update methods are simply too slow to perform hundreds or thousands of buffer updates per frame and the current structure of the renderer requires this many buffer updates. Work is in progress to reduce this but this is a time consuming task, so no immediate results would be presentable for older hardware. For now it is important to have this work properly on all modern and future graphics hardware.

Of course I know that there's still a significant amount of hardware out there that does not meet these requirements so for the time being the existing GZDoom 1.8 version will continue to be developed - but it will be feature-frozen on the renderer side.

So what is this about?

GZDoom 2.x features a rewrite of the rendering code to run on modern OpenGL with a core profile. That means that all rendering is now using hardware buffers to pass its data to the graphics card. Depending on the maps being played this provides a performance increase of up to 20% on modern NVidia and Intel hardware. I have no reliable numbers for AMD yet, but it may be less there due to higher driver overhead for issuing draw calls.
This release does not have any new rendering features as the most recent 1.8.x version, but during the rewrite I was able to elimintate some precision issues with the lighting code for sprites so there may be some minor improvement there.

UPDATE: The download was replaced with 2.0.01 which corrects a bug with not rendering the sides of 3D floors.

GZDoom 1.8.6 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Thu May 08, 2014 10:00*

This is just a bugfix release that addresses one critical issue with loading of 7z files.

The complete list of changes from 1.8.5:

* 7z loader could crash on some files due to memory corruption while converting lump names
* fixed a problem with using Thing_Raise on monsters using the 'canraise' state flag.
* made interpolation of angle changes via ACS and DECORATE an opt-in feature instead of forcing it unconditionally, restoring default behavior to what it was before 1.8.5.

GZDoom 1.8.5 released.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat May 03, 2014 12:32*

A new release is online.

This contains all the bugfixes from the last 8 months and a few minor new features.
Please note: This is the first official release that was built with Visual Studio 2013. Although I have set the project to create an XP compatible binary I have no means to check if that worked. Please report if it doesn't, I'll try to fix it then if necessary.

GZDoom 1.8.4 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Aug 27, 2013 23:07*

Due to a serious bug with scaled texture positioning a new release is online.

Aside from that critical fix, new features include:

* mod-customizable automap overlay colors
* APROP_ViewHeight and APROP_AttackZOffset for ACS
* Player.Aircapacity property which is used as a multiplier for the level's air supply.
* BLOCKHITSCAN line flag
* ACS CheckFlag function

and several other smaller additions plus more bugfixes.

Since my FTP problems still remain unsolved, here's the download:

GZDoom 1.8.3 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Jul 28, 2013 9:46*

A new version has just been released.

The most notable change is the ability to display sprites on the cheat (IDDT)- automap.
Other changes include:

* A_BFGSpray now can use the FOILINVUL flag on the BFGExtra actor.
* Player.UseRange property
* string table access for A_Print family.
* damage type specific extreme death and crash states.
* A_Light can now use negative light offsets in GL.

Fixes include

* new compatibility settings for some maps
* fixed some damage type checks for type specific death states

Due to some ISP related problems I cannot upload the new version to my server so please download it from the attachment to this post until the problem gets fixed.

GZDoom 1.8.2 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Jun 23, 2013 13:58*

A new version is available. This is a bugfix release and fixes two problems of recent versions:

* wiping the screen caused parts of the level not to be rendered
* texture scaling was broken

IMPORTANT UPDATE: I had to make a hotfix because the savegame versioning was broken in ZDoom's initial git repository. Please upgrade immediately to 1.8.2.
The 1.8.1 package has been deleted from the server already.

GZDoom 1.8.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Jun 09, 2013 9:07*

This updates GZDoom to ZDoom version 2.7.0. Look over there for a list of new features, it's quite long...

GZDoom 1.7.1 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Feb 10, 2013 10:39*

After a seeminly endless delay due to various problems with ZDoom's SVN code here it finally is:

The new GZDoom 1.7.1.

This is mostly done to fix the problems with the new lighting mode. Of course it also adds all the more recent fixes done in ZDoom.

GZDoom 1.7.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Dec 23, 2012 11:59*

A new version is out - with a new lighting mode that's even closer to the software renderer!

Other changes to the last version include:

* berserk indicator on alternative HUD
* support for BFG edition IWADs
* sound precaching through MAPINFO

GZDoom 1.5.6 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Nov 14, 2010 13:54*

A new version is out!

Major changes to the last version include:

* customizable intermission sequences
* more supported music formats (XMI, HMI, HMP)
* better support of Timidity++ for extended MIDI formats
* less quirky jumping code
* major redesign of portal clipping. Problems with one sided lines in portals should be almost completely gone now.

Update: 1.5.05 has been uploaded which fixes some bugs with nonstandard portals and reflective floors.
Update2: 1.5.06 fixes a crash bug with more than 16 portals in a map.

GZDoom 1.5.3 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Thu Sep 23, 2010 11:19*

A new release is out.

The one major new feature is the improved menu code. The new menu can be fully controlled with the mouse.

Aside from that it's mostly bugfixes related to the textured automap code that was introduced in 1.5.2

GZDoom 1.5.2 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fri Aug 27, 2010 23:52*

A new release is available.

New features include:

* textured automap
* automap keys configurable in the menu and console
* USDF support
* FluidSynth support for MIDI playback (FluidSynth DLL not included for size reasons.)

Bug fixes:

* some maps with polyobjects got their geometry moved acrpss the map.

UPDATE:

Another release is available which fixes a recently introduced bug in ZDoom's internal node builder.

GZDoom 1.5.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Wed Aug 11, 2010 7:47*

This release coincides with ZDoom 2.5.0 so the main new feature is the new polyobject code. Of course all other ZDoom changes of recent months are added, too.

GZDoom 1.4.8 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Mar 27, 2010 9:39*

A new version is out.

Important new fixes include a critical level transition bug in Strife that made it impossible to get to the Abandoned Front Base and could cause the game to abort if you tried.

It also fixes an issue with item placement in maps at an angle that is not a multiple of 45Â°.

UPDATE: 1.4.7 has been released. This version fixes 2 semi-critical bugs:

* animations for menu textures using the original graphics names did not work
* Strife conversations could only be initiated with shootable actors.

UPDATE again: 1.4.8 has been released due to another bug introduced by recent ZDoom changes

* picking up an invulnerability sphere while being invulnerable caused a crash.

GZDoom 1.4.5 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fri Mar 19, 2010 8:42*

A new version is out which includes the recent ZDoom extensions to the ambient sounds and of course all fixes and improvements from the last 2 months.

If you downloaded 1.4.4 in the short time it was out please update immediately. That version has some issues which I only noticed after uploading it but before making a news post.

GZDoom 1.4.3 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fri Jan 29, 2010 23:22*

A new version is online.

This is merely a bugfix release that addresses 2 semi-serious bugs:

* shaders did not compile on ATI cards anymore
* sprites were not properly sorted when rendering a mirror.

GZDoom 1.4.2 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Jan 24, 2010 11:05*

This updates GZDoom to ZDoom v2.4.1 and also fixes a few bugs:

* sprite display on older graphics cards works again
* sprites with an alpha channel again display as intended
* Maps containing FraggleScript could crash when playing sounds
* some rare crashes with changing a ScriptedMarine's skin.

Important note:

Beginning with this release there won't be downloadable source packages anymore. With a public SVN server I don't see much use in them as they only make some less informed people get outdated sources instead of the most recent development code and due to the time needed to prepare them they always have been a delaying factor for new releases so I hope that in the future there'll be more frequent official releases.

In case somebody needs a specific version they can all be found and downloaded from the tags/ directory on the SVN server.

GZDoom 1.4.1 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Tue Jan 05, 2010 10:36*

Version 1.4.1 is online. This is only a bugfix release that addresses several issues that have been found in 1.4.0. Here's the list of important fixes:

* models did not display correctly
* some moving cameras no longer worked.
* some menu layout fixes
* Strife dialogue layout fixes
* improved precision for Floor_Waggle
* improved performance with sprites that contain a lot of empty room on the outside.

GZDoom 1.4.0 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fri Jan 01, 2010 8:52*

To coincide with today's release of ZDoom 2.4.0 here's the latest GZDoom release.

Major new features:

* Monsters can no longer get stuck in each other.
* Generalized version of A_BishopMissileWeave and A_CStaffMissileSlither, called A_Weave
* portals can be defined with linedefs, like in Eternity.
* Major improvement of portal robustness. All geometry lying between the camera and the portal is now discarded before being rendered so there's far less restrictions in defining a portal's layout. (OpenGL only!)

Major fixes:

* replacing puffs now gets recognized properly when checking the damage type
* the options menu no longer gets cut off by the screen borders
* moving a sky viewpoint now is interpolated properly (see Daedalus MAP21's intro for an example)
* Hexen's Flechette-Grenade now gets thrown properly when viewing up or down.

GZDoom 1.3.17 final released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sun Nov 29, 2009 17:32*

The final release of GZDoom 1.3.17 is online.

This includes all features from the recent betas plus several bug fixes from the beta testing phase.

New features since 1.2.01:

* load contents of directories into lump directory
* load 7z files like Zips
* more compression algorithms for Zip loading: Implode, Reduce, BZip2 and LZMA.
* per-linedef texture scaling
* limited support of MBF beta emulation features.
* support of user-supplied texture shader effexts. There's on example file in gzdoom.pk3:

      hardwareshader floor4_8 
      {
          shader "shaders/glsl/func_wavex.fp"
          speed 1.4
      }

* dynamic lights can be specified directly in DECORATE by adding 'Light("lightname") to a state definition.
* and of course all the stuff that got added to ZDoom in recent months

Important bugfixes since 1.2.01:

* burn wiping finally works without producing a white screen
* fixed a long standing bug with sprites showing through horizon lines

Improvements since 1.2.01:

* new resource file management code for added robustness and flexibility
* improved renderer performance. The speed hit with using 'quality' mode is mostly gone and performance overall is much better than in previous versions, in particular with NVidia based hardware.
* major improvements of sky positioning

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR NVIDIA USERS:

You MUST update the driver to at least 191.07 for this if you want to run it with shaders. Older versions contain a bug in the shader compiler that affects all of GZDoom's GLSL shaders.

GZDoom 1.3.04 - 1.3.13 Beta
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Fri Oct 16, 2009 23:06*

Here's the latest beta version that includes all the latest changes. This is mostly for testing so that I can get better feedback if everything still works. I think it can be used for regular playing but please be aware that this has not been extensively tested yet.

1.3.10 adds a new 'bench' command that should make running tests easier.

GZDoom 1.0.30 released
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Jan 05, 2008 10:57*

The latest version is out!

Again, this one updates to the latest ZDoom SVN revision (currently 666 ;) ) so all the new ZDoom features like SBARINFO, TEAMINFO and DECORATE extensions are in.

Also new: Screen wipes are finally working in OpenGL mode! However, I was only able to test this on one computer with Windows Vista running so I can't guarantee that it will work properly for everyone.

GZDoom 1.0.19
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*Sat Sep 09, 2006 12:10*

At last I was able to merge all the latest ZDoom changes into GZDoom and make the necessary adjustments to make it all work with the OpenGL renderer.
