=== Compatibility ===

  -donut <x> <y>          Use the specified magic values when emulating 
                          behavior caused by memory overruns from 
                          improperly constructed donuts. In Vanilla Strife 
                          this can differ depending on the operating 
                          system. The default (if this option is not 
                          specified) is to emulate the behavior when 
                          running under Windows 98.

                          values are "1.2" and "1.31".  

  -setmem <version>       Specify DOS version to emulate for NULL pointer 
                          dereference emulation. Supported versions are:

                          DOS 7.1 (Windows 98).  

  -spechit <n>            Use the specified magic value when emulating 
                          spechit overruns.

                    player.  

  -strictdemos      When recording or playing back demos, disable any 
                    extensions of the vanilla demo format - record demos 
                    as vanilla would do, and play back demos as vanilla 
                    would do.  

  -timedemo <demo>  Play back the demo named demo.lmp, determining the 
                    framerate of the screen.

  -bpp <bpp>           Specify the color depth of the screen, in bits per 
                       pixel.  

  -fullscreen          Run in fullscreen mode.  

  -geometry <WxY>[wf]  Specify the dimensions of the window or fullscreen 
                       mode. An optional letter of w or f appended to the

                      place and all items respawn after 30 seconds.  

  -autojoin           Automatically search the local LAN for a multiplayer 
                      server and join it.

                      participating in the game itself.

                      reducing the amount of network bandwidth needed.  

  -extratics <n>      Send n extra tics in every packet as insurance 
                      against dropped packets.  

  -ignoreversion      When running a netgame server, ignore version 
                      mismatches between the server and the client. Using 
                      this option may cause game desyncs to occur, or 
                      differences in protocol may mean the netgame will 
                      simply not function at all.  

  -left               Run as the left screen in three screen mode.  

  -localsearch        Search the local LAN for running servers.  

  -newsync            Use new network client sync code rather than the 
                      classic sync code. This is currently disabled by 
                      default because it has some bugs.  

  -nodes <n>          Autostart the netgame when n nodes (clients) have 
                      joined the server.  

  -port <n>           Use the specified UDP port for communications, 
                      instead of the default (2342).  

  -privateserver      When running a server, don't register with the 
                      global master server. Implies -server.  

  -query <address>    Query the status of the server running on the given 
                      IP address.

                      of active servers.

                      connections.  

  -servername <name>  When starting a network server, specify a name for 
                      the server.  

  -solo-net           Start the game playing as though in a netgame with a 
                      single player. This can also be used to play back 
                      single player netgame demos.  

  -timer <n>          For multiplayer games: exit each level after n 
                      minutes.

=== Dehacked and WAD merging ===

  -aa <files>        Equivalent to "-af <files> -as <files>".  

  -af <files>        Simulates the behavior of NWT's -af option, merging 
                     flats into the main IWAD directory. Multiple files 
                     may be specified.  

  -as <files>        Simulates the behavior of NWT's -as option, merging 
                     sprites into the main IWAD directory. Multiple files 
                     may be specified.  

  -deh <files>       Load the given dehacked patch(es)  

  -merge <files>     Simulates the behavior of deutex's -merge option, 
                     merging a PWAD into the main IWAD. Multiple files may 
                     be specified.
