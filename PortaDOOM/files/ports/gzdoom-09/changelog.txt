12. Feb. 2006
- Made the previous -nogl option a CVAR so that it can be saved and controlled
  from the menu. Now it is possible to set GZDoom to permanent software
  rendering.
  
11. Feb. 2006
- Changed light handling for weapons in Doom lighting mode so that their
  brightness better fits the surroundings.
- Fixed: The LineID hash chain used signed short for its indices. This
  made it impossible to manipulate lines with an index higher than 32767

9. Feb. 2006
- Fixed: GL nodes created by GLBSP can contain partner seg references that
  are not what is expected of them. To avoid problems I have to explicitly
  check for both back sector and partner seg to make sure there is something
  valid on the back side of a seg.

7. Feb. 2006
- Fixed: The Inquisitor can be hurt by explosive damage but only if it comes
  from non Inquisitors. 
- Fixed The inquisitor's grenades must not teleport.

5. Feb. 2006
- Fixed: The flame thrower parts were missing their spawn state.

4. Feb 2006
- Added fake contrast handling to the GL renderer, including a menu option to
  switch it off.
- Added a Transfer_WallLight special which is doing for walls what
  Transfer_CeilingLight and Transfer_FloorLight are doing for sectors.
- Fixed: GL nodes v5 didn't check properly for minisegs.
- Added a new hires texture namespace: Everything between HI_START/HI_END
  will replace any previously defined texture of the same name and take
  its scaling/positioning information.
- Made the texture scaling factor a float so that hires scaling is more
  precise.

3. Feb 2006
- Removed the debug messages for moving torches out of walls.

31. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Macil can't be killed by the first Sigil stage.

28. Jan 2006
- Fixed: bot_observer cleared the MF_FRIENDLY flag off the player.

27. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Strife log messages should zero-terminate the text in the lump.
- Fixed: Warped textures with translucency must clear the texture buffer first.

24. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Due to some code reorganization the fuzz effect used incorrect
  translucency settings.
- Fixed: Particles used incorrect coordinates for drawing.
- Fixed: Unless the model code can sort polygons models must not use
  translucency.
- Fixed: Objects with RenderStyle 'Normal' must not assume that the actor's 
  translucency setting is 1.
- Extended hires texture code to look in subfolders named as in Doomsday in
  addition to ones named as in ZDoomGL.
  
22. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Decals weren't affected by dynamic lights.
- Fixed: Dumpmap didn't work with GL nodes. It doesn't crash anymore but
  the written nodes will be invalid.

20. Jan 2006
- Fixed: The new FS text format function needs to know which is the first 
  argument to print.

19. Jan 2006
- Fixing the clamp bug finally allowed me to activate the multisampling
  (antialiasing) option. But since it requires a complete engine restart
  it isn't in the menu yet. Set gl_vid_multisample manually to the value you
  want. 0 is off.
- Fixed: GLWall::GLWF_CLAMPX had the value 0 so the flag could not be checked.
  This could cause some texturing artifacts with non-wrappable textures.
- Replaced the std::string class used in the GL lightdata parser with ZDoom's
  own string class. There is no immediate benefit but why use two different
  implementations for the same thing?
- Cleaned up the GL code so that the upcoming transition to floating point will
  get somewhat easier.
  
18. Jan 2006
- Added 'Smooth sprite edges' option to the menu. Thanks to DaniJ for a suggestion
  to make this more efficient.
- Fixed: P_RipperBlood tried to get the blood color from the missile, not the
  victim.

16. Jan 2006
- Changed the coordinate system of the renderer so that one map unit is one
  rendering unit and that the orientation is the same. The old scale is a 
  remnant of PrBoom's renderer which was more concerned with 'correctness' than
  is really necessary. All the needed translations can be handled with
  the translation matrix much easier.
- Swapped y and z in all coordinate variable names I could find to bring the
  naming of axes in line with the rest of the code.
  
15. Jan 2006
- Removed some obsolete code from t_script.cpp
- Fixed no water damage hack for Legacy maps. Now it can be overridden in
  the FS lump and it only gets activated when playing Doom format maps.
- Replaced all string format commands in FS source with ZDoom's string class.
  The old code was horrendously inefficient and not particularly robust.
- Major restructuring of FraggleScript code so that the parameter checks
  output the correct function name. Most functions just outputted a lame
  generic message that was of no help.
- Fixed: FraggleScript should be loaded after determining the map format, not
  before it.
  
14. Jan 2006
- Removed NOSECTOR flag from hate target. Now that this flag gets remapped to
  RF_INVISIBLE it affects the visibility of this thing for monsters. Having
  a TNT1 sprite is enough to make invisible so the flag isn't really necessary.
  
13. Jan 2006
- Added some code to compensate for geometry imprecisions in the mirror code.

12. Jan 2006
- Fixed: COMP_LIMITPAIN was broken when support for shooting other things than
  Lost Souls was added to the PE functions.

11. Jan 2006
- Fixed: The local SNDINFO loading code tried to load a nameless lump when no local
  SNDINFO was specified.
- The ultimate 'ATI sucks' fix: Some of ATIs graphics cards are so unprecise when 
  rendering geometry that each and every border between polygons must be seamless, 
  otherwise there are rendering artifacts worse than anything that could be seen 
  on Geforce 2's! Made this a menu option because the speed impact is quite severe
  and this special handling is not necessary on modern NVidia cards.

10. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Throwing a Dark Servant's summoning doll against a wall could infinitely
  replicate it.
- Fixed: Picking up a Soulsphere could reduce your health to 200 if it was above.
- Fixed: Scrollers must exclude items flagged with MF_NOBLOCKMAP.

9. Jan 2006
- Fixed: DevIL is apparently not robust enough to handle unidentifiable data without
  crashing in all cases. Therefore I enclosed the call to ilLoadL in an exception 
  handler.
  
7. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Specifying an invalid model frame did not output an error.
- Removed the MF_NOSECTOR flag from everything except the decal and the regular
  map spot. This flag was only causing problems because any check depending on
  the sector lists were skipped for thse things. Unlike Doom there's much more
  that uses these lists today.
- Fixed: The obituary code could crash when a player was killed by another
  player who happened not to have a ready weapon at the precise moment of death.
- Added an MD3 renderer.

6. Jan 2006
- Moved Pickup, Use and Drop states into a CustomInventory subclass to bring
  the behavior in line with upcoming ZDoom versions.
- Added an MD3 loader and cleaned up the model code.

5. Jan 2006
- Added support for true color textures as raw graphics and in the TX_ namespace.
  These textures will only work in GL mode.
  
3. Jan 2006
- Fixed: Added some NULL pointer checks to the texture code. Several places 
  where it was possible that no texture was selected checked some texture 
  properties with this invalid pointer.

30. Dec 2005
- Moved some previously hard coded icon definitions for the alternative HUD
  into the ALTHUDCF lump.

27. Dec 2005
- Added special escape character handling to SC_GetString. Normally it should be
  on but for sprite frame sequences in DECORATE it must not be used at all because
  they have to treat the backslash as a regular character.
  
25. Dec 2005
- Fixed: dynamic lights used the hub timer, not the level timer.
- Fixed: Floatbobbing used the hub timer, not the level timer.
- Fixed: Gravity calculations for floatbobbing objects had to be reverted
  to ZDoom's method because it is able to reset the timer if it desyncs.

23. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The fixed colormap selection code didn't properly check the player's
  camera.
- Fixed: The calculations for desaturation never fully desaturated the picture
  because they treated a value of 32 as fully desaturated, not 31 as was intended.
  
21. Dec 2005
- Added MF2_NOTELEPORT to ABlood.

20. Dec 2005
- Fixed: Some scaling calculations for the alternative HUD were wrong.
- Fixed: Handling of the outsidefog MAPINFO option was broken.

16. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The alternate HUD didn't update the inventory's start item
- Fixed: The model lookup code didn't use the hash chains properly.


14. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The code that moved objects out of walls contained several
  serious bugs.
- Fixed: save and load CCMDs didn't use the savedir CVAR.
- Fixed: Hexen's wall torch was missing the FIXMAPTHINGPOS flag.


13. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The player could use things through closed doors if the door was
  farther away than 64 map units.


12. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The order of checks in the model parser was incorrect and could
  crash if it tried to access a non-existing actor class.
- Added drag&drop for *.pk3 and *.zip files.
- Fixed: Lump names with '.' in them weren't handled when loading from ZIPs.


10. Dec 2005
- Fixed: 2-sided mid texture offsets were broken by a non functioning bug fix.
- Fixed: The intermission background drawer must clear the screen in widescreen mode.


8. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The order of gravity application and calculation were reversed from
  Doom's original method.
- Fixed: Portals that don't draw anything due to exceeded recursive depth
  have to clear the screen to avoid HOM.
- Fixed: Intermission texts from external lumps weren't 0-terminated.
- Added NULL pointer check to the path follower's interpolation method.


6. Dec 2005
- Added more flexible color correction options to the menu.
- Added first stage of model support: Assignment to sprite frames
- Fixed: resurrect and powerup cheats crashed when used outside a game.


5. Dec 2005
- Fixed: Any sky change must reset the sky's scroll position.


4. Dec 2005
- Fixed: 4 digit ammo numbers weren't displayed correctly on the HUD.
- Added support for loading sounds from packed ZIPs.


3. Dec 2005
- Fixed: The code to fill texturing gaps didn't properly check for skies.
- Added handling for escaped quotation marks to sc_man.cpp
- Fixed: The PNG decoder always wrote as many pixels as a byte could contain,
  even if it was the last byte and the width not a multiple of the pixels per byte.
- Fixed: All of Doom's monster corpses didn't clear MF3_ISMONSTER so the
  massacre cheat made them disappear.
- Removed support for my private PicZ texture format. I never released a tool
  that could create it and I finally got rid of the last WAD that used it.
  

1. Dec - 3. Dec 2005
- Added support for ZIPs as replacements for WADs because for model support
  I need the longer paths. 8 characters simply aren't enough.
 

29. Nov 2005
- Fixed: The rendering code didn't copy the desaturation information for 3D-floors.
 
  
27. Nov 2005
- Fixed: sky boxes interfered with mirrored planes and during rendering.


26. Nov 2005
- Added option to assign a 3D-floor definition line a line id.


25. Nov 2005
- Fixed: Sound lookup for FraggleScript must look for d_sound and sound if it
  wants to play a sound.
- Fixed: The bouncing code for Strife's grenades could make them explode at the
  ceiling.
- Fixed: The HateTarget couldn't die.
- Made a slight change to the wall rendering code because the code didn't preserve
  some important values properly.


24. Nov 2005
- Fixed: A_VileChase must clear the MF3_CRASHED flag for resurrected monsters
- Added check for split doors to sound traversal code.
- Copied a few 2.0.98 fixes I overlooked.


23. Nov 2005
- Fixed: Shooting Heretic's mace straight up caused weird effects because the
  vertical speed wasn't clamped to reasonable values.
- Fixed: Wiping didn't work in the software renderer.
  
  
20. Nov 2005
- Fixed a ZDoom bug: Cameras were always cleared when loading a savegame.
- Added support for GL_ARB_OCCLUSION_QUERY to the portal code. This gives a 
  significant speed boost to SSD's MAP03.
- Added -nogl command line switch which completely disables all GL related code.
- Added gl_vid_compatibility CVAR to force the system to use a GL mode that is
  compatible with OpenGL 1.1. Some drivers don't report hardware support properly
  so with those this has to be used to disable any more modern features.
  
  
19. Nov 2005
- Added reflective planes. They are defined by the new line special 159:
  Sector_SetPlaneReflection(tag, floor_reflect, ceiling_reflect).
  This does not work for slopes!
- Fixed: Some translucent 3D-floor-walls weren't rendered.
- Fixed: Exiting a level while crouched destroyed the view height information
  for the next level.
- Added gl_render_segs CVAR for those who happen to own a graphics card that
  likes to create white dots at the edges of sectors.
- Fixed: The different pitch handling between hardware and software renderer
  could cause desyncs in netgames. Now netgames force the limited pitch of
  the software renderer.
- Fixed: When upgrading to ZDoom 2.0.98 I forgot to copy some code to handle
  the 'right' key in the menu.
- Fixed: FlickerLight2 didn't work when the secondary size was smaller than 
  the primary size.
- Fixed: ZDoom's new scrolling code was doing some incorrect comparisons which
  resulted in the player being stuck in one place in Strife's MAP11.


17. Nov 2005
- Reduced the intensity of the berserk effect.


13. Nov. 2005
- Fixed: Setting a software renderer mode didn't clear the setmodeneeded variable.
  This caused various strange effects in the console.
  

12. Nov. 2005
- Fixed: Static_Init to set a sector's color was broken when using ZDoom format.
- Fixed: The deep water splash code was missing a NULL pointer check.
- Fixed: Hub intermission data wasn't serialized properly if the hub was empty.
- Fixed: The GL initialization code forgot to clear its vertex array when a 
  new level was started.
- Fixed: Some enhanced vision effects were active even when gl_enhanced_lightamp
  was off.
- Fixed: When upgrading to ZDoom 2.0.98 I accidentally deleted the
  HealState handling in A_VileChase. ZDoom really needs to upgrade as well. :(
  

10. Nov. 2005
- Fixed: A_ThrowGrenade was missing some MF4_RANDOMIZE checks.


6. Nov. 2005
- Fixed: Sector color assignment with Static_Init was broken.
- Fixed: Dynamic lights affected weapon sprites when nightvision was on.
- Fixed: Transparent textures on 3D-floors were drawn with black holes.
- Fixed: non-existent weapon sprites crashed the software renderer.


4. Nov. 2005
- Fixed some bugs introduced by ZDoom 2.0.98.
- Fixed: The sloped 3D-light code coulds cause an infinite recursion.


3. Nov 2005
- Upgraded to ZDoom 2.0.98


2. Nov 2005 
- Implemented a Strife log viewer for the alternate HUD.
- Added sloped 3D lighting support


1. Nov 2005
- Fixed a sector assignment problem in the GL nodes loader.


31. Oct 2005
- Allowed GLDEFS as a generic name for DOOMDEFS/HTICDEFS etc.
- Added support for Quake2/Unreal style skyboxes
- Fixed a few texture type problems


28. Oct 2005
- Fixed: The crouching code broke a player sprite's y-scaling.


27. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Two-sided walls weren't affected by a weapon's extralight.
- Fixed: Floor skies with height differences between sectors had holes.


25. Oct 2005
- Fixed: The game crashed when r_opengl.dll was not found. Now it aborts
  with a fatal error.
  

23. Oct 2005
- Added rocket smoke sprites to GZDoom wad and created another actor
  instead of using LavaSmoke.
- Fixed: Weapons with WIF_NOAUTOFIRE didn't start to fire when selected
  manually and pressing the fire button before the weapon was fully raised.


22. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Using masked textures on one-sided walls created rendering holes.


21. Oct 2005
- Added support for the BLOODLESSIMPACT flag on puffs
- Fixed: Ripper missiles ignored the BLOODLESSIMPACT flag.
- Fixed: Explosions directly above another object had incorrect damage
  calculations.
  
  
20. Oct 2005
- Changed screenshot type for the GL renderer from BMP to PNG.
  The screenshot_type CVAR still has no effect though.


19. Oct 2005
- Changed the sector lighting to be closer to the way Doom is doing it.
  I kept the old method as an option though.


18. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Making a screenshot crashed when screenshot_dir didn't exist.


17. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Movement collision checks failed when inside a sector with lower
  height than the actor being tested.
- Fixed: Loading GL nodes from a WAD failed.
  

16. Oct 2005
- Fixed Doom2's boss shooter so that it works with Dehacked again.
- Fixed: ACS_Suspend crashed when no scripts had been started.


15. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Drawing a skybox interfered with flooding texture gaps.
- Fixed: Negative frags were displayed without sign.


13. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Sprite sorting was broken when multiple translucent 3D-floors were involved
- Fixed: The fixes for missing textures done yesterday introduced some unwanted side effects.


12. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Recalculation of the light list wasn't done properly when a sector's height
  was interpolated by the renderer.
- Fixed: Sorting of translucent flats was done incorrectly
- Fixed: Missing texture render hacks with sky flats didn't work.
- Fixed: Flooding texture gaps must not write into the Z-buffer.
- Fixed: The speed for crouching down was applied inconsistently.


10. Oct 2005
- Changed: Removed all player error messages from FraggleScript and let them silently
  fail instead. 


9. Oct 2005
- Fixed: FraggleScript's ceiling height changer did not stop the sector interpolation.
- Fixed: Dynamic lights were not properly cleared when deactivated
- Fixed: The enhanced light amplification handling was broken.
- Fixed the Inventory code that got broken by an improper bug fix in ZDoom 2.0.97.
- Added a crouch button in addition to the toggle.


7. Oct 2005
- Fixed: FloorAndCeiling_LowerRaise couldn't activate both movers at the same time.
- Fixed: The boss brain was effectively deaf because it didn't get linked into
  the sector's thing list
- Reactivated HIRESTEX.
- Fixed: The horizon code treated viewz as float instead of fixed_t.
- Changed texture deletion to delete each texture separetely. Apparently some
  ATI drivers don't like deleting lists with invalud textures.
- More crouching fixes.


6. Oct 2005
- Fixed: A_SpawnBishop and A_GenWizard didn't keep track of the monster count
  properly.
- Fixed: AMinotaur::Die didn't properly check for valid friendly Minotaurs
- Fixed: The FraggleScript actor translation table had Megasphere misspelled.
- Released 0.9.8 because the particle crash is rather serious.
- Fixed: Particles in sectors with 3D-floors caused a crash because I read
  the sector from an incorrect variable.
- Fixed: Crouching outside of a game crashed


5. Oct 2005
- Did a few minor adjustments to the crouching code. It's still not polished
  enough for an official feature though.
- Released 0.9.7
- Fixed: 3D floors could block switches.


4. Oct 2005
- Fixed: Levels with no normal nodes whatsoever ignored accompanying GWA files.
- Finished the adjustments for crouching.


3. Oct 2005
- Added crouching because Enjay sent me a PM that took at least an hour to type. ;)


2. Oct 2005
- Added support for viewheight command in FraggleScript's runcommand handler


30. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: Did some sanity checks for partner segs because GLBSP can create incorrect
  references
  
  
28. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: Decals on walls that don't cover the entire linedef were not drawn.
- Fixed: The sky cap was drawn in an incorrect color when enhanced nigh vision
  was on.


27. Sep. 2005
- Moved the OpenGL initialization code into a separate DLL. Hopefully that allows
  me to implement a Direct3D renderer.
  

26. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: 2-sided polyobjects used the wrong sector to align their textures.
- Fixed: Mirrors on two-sided walls do not block the view. Instead they won't
  get displayed as mirrors.


25. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: The clipping code could misinterpret certain sloped lines as obstructing
  the view even though they were not.
  
  
23. Sep. 2005
- Did some optimizations to the portal clipping code. Unfortunately it didn't speed
  up such problem maps as SSD or TNT4 as much as I hoped but it's at least a little
  better now.
 

22. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: Translucent flats in stacked sectors were drawn with the incorrect amount
  of translucency.
- Did some performance tests with levels that use sky boxes in an abusive manner.
  I had to conclude that there is no way to improve performance to a tolerable
  level.
  

21. Sep. 2005
- Improved handling of stacked sectors. MAP04 of Zen Dynamics now displays
  as intended.
  

20. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: The color parser for Static_Init was broken.
- Fixed: The decal creation code can create invalid decals. These should
  not be rendered of course.
- Fixed: Sector_Set3DFloor ignored the 'draw all sides' bit.
- Fixed: The insides of a 3D floor were only rendered when the back side of 
  the linedef in question also had 3D-floors defined
- Fixed: The SpawnedThings array for FraggleScript was not saved.
- Added configuration lump for the alternative HUD so icons can be selectively
  replaced or removed


19. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: FraggleScript instant sector movers didn't clear the sector's
  floor or ceilingdata right away.


17. Sep. 2005
- Added support for GL nodes V5.
- Disabled HIRESTEX pending the outcome of an ongoing discussion about texture
  management at the forums of newdoom.com. If that works out it should offer
  all the required functionality in a manner that would be compatible across
  source ports so I won't do a non-standard implementation for now.


16. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: The flickering dynamcic light types had some properties mixed up.


14. Sep. 2005
- Added support for ZDoomGL's HIRESTEX lump


11. Sep. 2005

- Fixed: If non-power-of-2 textures are not supported a patch's scaling
  factor has to be retrieved before the texture can be used to set
  texture coordinates.
- Fixed: Legacy doesn't have water damage so it has to be disabled when
  FraggleScript is found. Maybe I'll add an option later.
- Fixed: Sprites should be precached as patches, not textures.
- Added support for Legacy's digital music names which start with 'O_'.
  But since ZDoom already handles all music types it can be any format, not
  just MP3 or OGG.
- Relaxed: Legacy ignores duplicate variable definitions so I turned the
  error into a warning
- Fixed: The token buffer for FraggleScript was too small. That caused a
  crash in DSV4(Legacy)'s MAP01.
- Fixed: I forgot to recompile the latest changes so line type 272 wasn't
  working
- Time for 0.9.4!
- To have some more test material I converted the XG scripts of the first 3 
  Doom64 maps to FS. For that I also added some new functions and options.
- Fixed: Owner-less missiles could crash the game when trying to activate
  a shootable line special.
- Finished adding all Legacy FS commands and all quick tests done so far
  look good.


10. Sep. 2005
- Started adding the missing Legacy FS commands. Fortunately most is
  rather trivial stuff that should be easy to do.
- Added some rudimentary parsing of the level info block. The important
  options should work but don't expect this to be a perfect emulation.
  Some of it is being done too late to have any effect where it should.
  
  
9. Sep. 2005
- added a third timer to the HUD: It counts the time spent in the
  current level and is only visible in hubs.
- Finished adjusting the Eternity FraggleScript source. I can play
  the Eternity version of DSV4 except it seems that Eternity isn't
  handling Boom colormaps correctly. The maps were clearly designed
  for a different behavior. After checking with Legacy I noticed that
  it can't handle the colormap command properly either so I made it no-op.


8. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: Light types weren't transferred for associated lights.
- Fixed: Undefined dynamic lights weren't properly detected and crashed.
- Did a first quick FS check with Nimrod. Noticed that I had to modify
  the sound and music commands because the way they work is far too
  hard coded to Doom's naming conventions and are logically not aware
  of SNDINFO.
  For sounds it first checks whether a sound of that name already exists.
  If not 'DS' is prepended to the name and a new logical sound defined.
  For music it first checks for an exact name match. If that fails it
  prepends 'D_' to the name and checks again.
- Continued with FraggleScript. Most importantly cameras, moving floors
  and ceilings and light level changers are working now.


7. Sep. 2005
- Finished with the deep sector hack code. 
- Did some work on FraggleScript's t_func.cpp. Approx 15% of it are
  done and I can run some simple scripts.


6. Sep. 2005
- Started adding code to handle vanilla deep sector hacks like
  in Strain MAP21. It mostly works but still has a few bugs.
- Fixed: The GWA loader didn't set the subsector for minisegs.
- Added some fallback options to the OpenGL startup code so that
  it runs on older cards.
- Fixed: Hitscan decals didn't show on 3D-floor faces.
- Added support for sector action things in 3D-floor control sectors.


5. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: Before drawing any 2D stuff the fragment programs must be
  disabled.
- Changed DElevator to be aware of 3D floors
- Fixed several issues from adding hires texture support.


4. Sep. 2005
- Fixed: The depth fog menu option had incorrect parameter settings.
- Added support for Doomsday hires texture packs. Also added precaching
  for GL textures because loading the hires textures when needed causes
  quite noticable delays.
- Fixed: The r_drawplayersprites CVAR was ignored by the GL renderer.
- Added support for Hexen's standard fog table. This doesn't support
  custom fog tables though.
- Continued with FraggleScript. Loading/Saving and actor management are
  done. Actor management was particularly ugly and only possible by using
  some intermediate class derived from DObject to handle the automatic
  pointer cleanup.
- Fixed: The parser for Legacy's linedef color format was broken.


3. Sep. 2005
- Changed the horizon renderer again. Now it draws a large set of 256x256
  tiles across the entire level. I hope this solves all the fog issues I had.
- Changed ZDoom.wad to GZDoom.wad because some people tried to put both
  ports into the same directory. Now they can.
- Started with the integration of FraggleScript. So far it compiles and
  I can link but it doesn't work yet. I hope the memory management works.
  FS depends so heavily on the zone heap (which ZDoom has thrown away
  quite some time ago) that there are probably a few leaks that remain
  undiscovered. I hope it isn't too bad.
  
  
2. Sep. 2005
-fixed: Volume changes for streamed sound formats did not work because
  it didn't store the channel's ID.
-added some checking code to the GWA loader to verify the validity of
  the loaded GL nodes. If the first seg in one subsector is found to
  be a miniseg the nodes will be considered invalid now.
-added code that handles the absence of wglChoosePixelFormatARB because
  There appaer to be drivers which still don't support it.
-fixed: The horizon code did not check for invulnerability colormaps.
-fixed: The code that handles missing upper/lower textures by flooding
  the gap with a flat texture did not remove its rotation matrix from
  the texture matrix stack.


1. Sep. 2005
-fixed a bug in the distance calculation of ADynamicLight::LinkLights.  
-reverted to my original horizon code with a few changes. Drawing the
