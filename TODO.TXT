[P0] Critical: (unstable until fixed)
================================================================================
[ ] LAUNCHER : When loading from an INI file set that as the 'current'
    directory? (or add as another search location)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Error messages:
 -  [ ] Unrecognised IWAD (not found and cannot be substituted)
 -  [-] When no engines remain after filter
 -  [X] When file is not found
 -  [ ] When param-value is missing, e.g. `/IWAD /PWAD ...`
 -  [ ] Unrecognised tag
 -  [-] parsing INI files
[ ] PSX DOOM apparently not working on GZDoom >3.2

[P1] Blocking: (cannot be released until fixed)
================================================================================
[ ] LAUNCHER : UI react instantly before processing wait
[-] LAUNCHER : FreeDOOM substitution
[ ] LAUNCHER : Use Shareware versions if DOOM2/HERETIC/HEXEN/STRIFE not found
[ ] LAUNCHER : If no PWAD, get title / description and game meta-data from IWAD
[ ] LAUNCHER : Implement class selection for Hexen in launcher.exe
[X] LAUNCHER : Implement BFG edition patching
[ ] LAUNCHER : Unable to 'warp' to named map; e.g. "UAC01" in cacowards/_2008/uacmnnew

[P2] Required: (lose-ends that need tying up)
================================================================================
[X] LAUNCHER : Gussy up game selection (like engine selection)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Gussy up skill selection
[ ] LAUNCHER : Cannot specify `/DEMO` in ini files
[X] LAUNCHER : Cannot specify `/USE` in ini files; e.g. 50shades
[ ] LAUNCHER : If no IWAD given, use default for type of engine
[ ] Updates to default configs:
 -  [ ] Sector light mode: Standard
 -  [X] Disable stats (not fair for portable use on non-personal systems)
 -  [ ] "m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show
        when inputting text, even when using a mouse"

[P3] Feature Enhancements:
================================================================================
[X] LAUNCHER : Batch files to test engines in each engine directory
    (will make testing on XP easier); depends on `use` in INI files?
[ ] Add Valiant: Vaccinated Edition
[ ] LAUNCHER : Add an `/AUTO` switch to skip any interaction (game selection)
[?] LAUNCHER : Detect OpenGL version and filter engines accordingly
    (currently an issue with this in QB64)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Generate a GAMEINFO lump on-demand?
[ ] Add Eternity engine (required somewhere in the Cacowards)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Handle VOICES1.WAD & SVE.WAD for STRIFE?
[ ] Include Crispy Doom music pack?
[ ] IWADs: (including Skill Names)
    [X] Harmony
    [ ] Hacx
    [X] Chex
    [ ] Adventures of Square (SHAREWARE)
    [ ] Rise of The Wool Ball
    [ ] Blade of Agony? (could do with its own settings file)

[P4] Content:
================================================================================
[ ] Does 20 Monsters work in ZDoom?
[ ] Move 3 Heures series to Community
[ ] WolfenDOOM package
[ ] Expand PSX DOOM Package to include:
 -  [ ] DOOM 64 EX

 -  [X] InnocenceX/X2/X3
     -  [ ] Add option to play with PSX / Classic weapons with new launcher

[-] Index pages at the end of each Cacowards; allows the separate Cacowards
    packages to have an index
[ ] Need launchers for bonus levels on Eternal Doom III
[ ] Add "The Given" LowDetail / update its page text
[ ] REKKR
[ ] Add 3 Heures Final
[ ] Update "Adventures of Square" to EP2
[ ] Create pages for the speedruns so that the author notes can be displayed

[ ] Total Conversions page ...
[ ] MegaWADs page ...
[ ] Episodes page ...
[ ] Onesies page ...
[-] Community Projects page ...
[ ] Vanilla page ...

[P5] Technical Debt: (making forward progress easier)
================================================================================
[ ] DOOM Retro : Next version will support binding F12
[X] LAUNCHER : Remove x64 binaries for all but latest GZDoom?
[ ] LAUNCHER : Add `gzdoom-default` definitions for older GZDoom versions
[X] LAUNCHER : Add `pre` property to game INIs to load files *BEFORE* PWAD
[X] LAUNCHER : Add a `/QUIT` switch to auto-close the engine
    (for creating the default config files)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Add a `/VER` param to select version constraints
[ ] LAUNCHER : Figure out what tags softpoly supports
[X] LAUNCHER : Mark "*-setup.exe" and other such engines as 'invisible'?
[ ] DOOM-Crusher : Add PKE, EPK to recognised PK3 formats
[ ] DOSMAG : Use `KEY` functions to simplify shortcut-key handling?
[ ] DOOM-Crusher : fail on "SOUND&MUSIC.WAD"
[ ] Add engine compatibility checks for Windows version
 -  [-] test engines on Windows XP
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows Vista?
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows 7
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows 8?
[ ] "SHELL" action improvements:
 -  [ ] add an action for launching files, rather than executing commands,
        i.e. verify the file exists before launching
 -  [X] use `_DONTWAIT`
 -  [ ] change to the directory of the file being launched.
        this will do away with the need for "%~dp0" in "play.bat" files
[ ] Additional PortaDOOM.exe icon sizes: 20, 24, 48, 64, 96?, 128, 256
[X] Icon for launcher.exe
 -  [ ] extra sizes: 20, 96?
[ ] Need a "dotted tab" for contents and index pages
[ ] Consider right alignment from middle of line (rulers?), ">>"
[ ] Tabs in Warning Boxes are broken
[ ] Convert the statusbar/dialogue to a theme set
[ ] doom.bat : Cannot substitute IWADs when playing demos!
[ ] Inclusion of RETRES.WAD in onesies\dt-lutz should be before the PWAD.
    I.e. we need to control load order or have `/MOD` option or some-such
[ ] A more common location for "bloom.cfg", so it doesn't have to be copied
    everywhere?
[ ] "Shadow of the Wool Ball" and "Blade of Agony" are IWADs,
    so require own configuration (set defaults script, GZDoom 3.2+)
