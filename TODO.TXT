[P0] Critical: (unstable until fixed)
================================================================================
LAUNCHER:
[ ] Implement class selection for Hexen in launcher.exe

[P1] Required: (cannot be released until fixed)
================================================================================
[-] Index pages at the end of each Cacowards; allows the separate Cacowards
    packages to have an index
[ ] Need launchers for bonus levels on Eternal Doom III
[ ] Add "The Given" LowDetail / update its page text

[P2] Feature Enhancements:
================================================================================
[ ] Expose GZDoom's software modes through their "porta-doom.ini" files?
[ ] Updates to default configs:
 -  [ ] Sector light mode: Standard
 -  [X] Disable stats (not fair for portable use on non-personal systems)
[ ] doom.bat : Handle VOICES1.WAD & SVE.WAD for STRIFE?
[ ] doom.bat : Add `-shotdir`, supported by a number of engines
[ ] Include Crispy Doom music pack?
[ ] IWADs: (including Skill Names)
    [ ] Harmony
    [ ] Hacx
    [ ] Chex / Chex3
    [ ] Adventures of Square (SHAREWARE)
    [ ] Rise of The Wool Ball
    [ ] Blade of Agony? (could do with its own settings file)
[-] DEH/BEX switch in play.bat & doom.bat to be able to auto-select DEH or BEX
    based on engine support -- e.g. ALIENS TC
[ ] "m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show when
     inputting text, even when using a mouse"

[P3] Content:
================================================================================
[ ] REKKR
[X] InnocenceX/X2/X3
 -  [ ] Add option to play with PSX / Classic weapons with new launcher
[ ] PSX Fall of Triton
[ ] Add 3 Heures Final
[ ] Update "Adventures of Square" to EP2
[ ] Create pages for the speedruns so that the author notes can be displayed
[ ] Help page to explain WAD page headers, glossary
[ ] Harmony IWAD page
[ ] Hacx IWAD page
[ ] N64 DOOM64.WAD warning on page
[ ] Total Conversions page ...
[ ] MegaWADs page ...
[ ] Episodes page ...
[ ] Onesies page ...
[-] Community Projects page ...
[ ] Vanilla page ...

[P4] Technical Debt: (making forward progress easier)
================================================================================
[ ] "SHELL" action improvements:
 -  [ ] add an action for launching files, rather than executing commands,
        i.e. verify the file exists before launching
 -  [ ] use `_DONTWAIT`
 -  [ ] change to the directory of the file being launched.
        this will do away with the need for "%~dp0" in "play.bat" files
[ ] Additional PortaDOOM.exe icon sizes: 20, 24, 48, 64, 96?, 128, 256
[X] Icon for launcher.exe
 -  [ ] extra sizes: 20, 96?
[ ] GZDoom v3.4+ now uses `vid_rendermode` CVAR
[ ] Alpha Accident (2016 Cacowards runner up), requires GZDoom 2.2 due to
    incompatibility with ZScript and a visual bug -- current work-around is to
    limit it to software rendering
[ ] Need a "dotted tab" for contents and index pages
[ ] Consider right alignment from middle of line (rulers?), ">>"
[ ] Tabs in Warning Boxes are broken
[ ] Unable to 'warp' to named map; e.g. "UAC01" in cacowards/_2008/uacmnnew
[ ] Convert the statusbar/dialogue to a theme set
[ ] doom.bat : Cannot substitute IWADs when playing demos!
[ ] Inclusion of RETRES.WAD in onesies\dt-lutz should be before the PWAD.
    I.e. we need to control load order or have `/MOD` option or some-such
[ ] A more common location for "bloom.cfg", so it doesn't have to be copied
    everywhere?
[ ] "Shadow of the Wool Ball" and "Blade of Agony" are IWADs,
    so require own configuration (set defaults script, GZDoom 3.2+)
[ ] dosmag: "^_^" not escaping properly

[ ] dosmag: Can we fix mousewheel scrolling with:
