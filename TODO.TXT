Pages:
================================================================================
[ ] Alpha Accident (2016 Cacowards runner up), requires GZDoom 2.2 due to
    incompatibility with ZScript and a visual bug -- current work-around is to
    limit it to software rendering
[ ] Create pages for the speedruns so that the author notes can be displayed
[ ] Help page to explain WAD page headers, glossary
[-] Index pages at the end of each Cacowards; allows the separate Cacowards
    packages to have an index
[ ] Need launchers for bonus levels on Eternal Doom III

PortaDOOM Alpha 3:

[ ] Harmony IWAD page
[ ] Hacx IWAD page
[ ] N64 DOOM64.WAD detection / warning
[ ] Total Conversions page ...
[ ] MegaWADs page ...
[ ] Episodes page ...
[ ] Onesies page ...
[X] Community Projects page ...
[ ] Vanilla page ...

Scripts:
================================================================================
[ ] Search 'current directory' for IWADs
[ ] Search for PWAD in IWAD directory too (since WADs folder is combined now)
[ ] GZDoom 3.2+ supports Rise of the Wool Ball as an IWAD
[X] GZDoom 3.2+ now supports ".iwad" & ".ipk3" extensions
[ ] "m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show when
     inputting text, even when using a mouse"
[ ] Support NWT merging in Chocolate-doom, e.g. Mordeth
[ ] Skill select should be in doom.bat since it knows the most about which
    game is being played
[ ] Need a "dotted tab" for contents and index pages

[X] Internally determine which 'game' (DOOM/HERETIC/HEXEN &c.) is being played
	[ ] Add Strife, Adventures of Square and Chex support / skill level names

[ ] Mods
	[ ] Add /MOD option to doom.bat so as to change save-folder based on mod
        selected; e.g. "strangeaeonsexp+HighNoonDrifter"
		
[ ] DOSmag: Themes
    [ ] Fix "?" invalid character
	[ ] Convert the statusbar/dialogue to a theme set
	[ ] Allow printing of text in any theme
	    (i.e. to allow printing of formatted text in statusbar/dialog)
	[ ] Add shadow to dialog box
	
[ ] Pre GZDoom-31 engines won't work with the configuration set to FluidSynth,
    they'll need their own config file
[ ] Consider right alignment from middle of line (rulers?), ">>"
[ ] Tabs in Warning Boxes are broken
[ ] Unable to 'warp' to named map; e.g. "UAC01" in cacowards/_2008/uacmnnew
