[P0] Critical: (unstable until fixed)
================================================================================
LAUNCHER:
[ ] parse command-line params
[ ] re-create the current UI and logic (will be replaced later)

[P1] Required: (cannot be released until fixed)
================================================================================
[-] Index pages at the end of each Cacowards; allows the separate Cacowards
    packages to have an index
[ ] Need launchers for bonus levels on Eternal Doom III
[ ] Add "The Given" LowDetail / update its page text

[P2] Feature Enhancements:
================================================================================
[ ] Updates to default configs:
 -  [ ] Sector light mode: Standard
 -  [ ] Disable stats (not fair for portable use on non-personal systems)
[ ] doom.bat : Handle VOICES1.WAD & SVE.WAD for STRIFE?
[ ] doom.bat : Add `-shotdir`, supported by a number of engines
[ ] Include Crispy Doom music pack?
[ ] IWADs: (including Skill Names)
    [ ] Harmony
    [ ] Hacx
    [ ] Chex / Chex3
    [ ] Adventures of Square (SHAREWARE)
    [ ] Rise of The Wool Ball
    [ ] Blade of Agony? (could do with its own settings file)
[-] DEH/BEX switch in play.bat & doom.bat to be able to auto-select DEH or BEX
    based on engine support -- e.g. ALIENS TC
[ ] "m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show when
     inputting text, even when using a mouse"

[P3] Content:
================================================================================
[ ] Update "Adventures of Square" to EP2
[ ] Create pages for the speedruns so that the author notes can be displayed
[ ] Help page to explain WAD page headers, glossary
[ ] Harmony IWAD page
[ ] Hacx IWAD page
[ ] N64 DOOM64.WAD warning on page
[ ] Total Conversions page ...
[ ] MegaWADs page ...
[ ] Episodes page ...
[ ] Onesies page ...
[-] Community Projects page ...
[ ] Vanilla page ...

[P4] Technical Debt: (making forward progress easier)
================================================================================
[ ] Alpha Accident (2016 Cacowards runner up), requires GZDoom 2.2 due to
    incompatibility with ZScript and a visual bug -- current work-around is to
    limit it to software rendering
[ ] Need a "dotted tab" for contents and index pages
[ ] Consider right alignment from middle of line (rulers?), ">>"
[ ] Tabs in Warning Boxes are broken
[ ] Unable to 'warp' to named map; e.g. "UAC01" in cacowards/_2008/uacmnnew
[ ] Convert the statusbar/dialogue to a theme set
[ ] doom.bat : Cannot substitute IWADs when playing demos!
[ ] Inclusion of RETRES.WAD in onesies\dt-lutz should be before the PWAD.
    I.e. we need to control load order or have `/MOD` option or some-such
[ ] A more common location for "bloom.cfg", so it doesn't have to be copied
    everywhere?
[ ] "Shadow of the Wool Ball" and "Blade of Agony" are IWADs,
    so require own configuration (set defaults script, GZDoom 3.2+)
[ ] dosmag: "^_^" not escaping properly
[ ] dosmag: Trap ALT+ENTER and override built in fullscreen switch with our own
