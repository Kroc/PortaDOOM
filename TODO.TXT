[X] Expose GZDoom's software modes through their "porta-doom.ini" files?

 -  [X] GZDoom v3.4+ now uses `vid_rendermode` CVAR
[ ] Updates to default configs:
 -  [ ] Sector light mode: Standard
 -  [X] Disable stats (not fair for portable use on non-personal systems)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Handle VOICES1.WAD & SVE.WAD for STRIFE?

    based on engine support -- e.g. ALIENS TC
[ ] "m_showinputgrid == '-1' allows for on-screen keyboard to never show when
     inputting text, even when using a mouse"

[P4] Technical Debt: (making forward progress easier)
================================================================================
[ ] LAUNCHER : Add `auto` property to game INIs to load files *BEFORE* PWAD
[ ] DOOM Retro : Next version will support binding F12
[X] LAUNCHER : Add a `/QUIT` switch to auto-close the engine
    (for creating the default config files)
[ ] LAUNCHER : Add a `/VER` param to select version constraints
[ ] LAUNCHER : Figure out what tags softpoly supports
[ ] LAUNCHER : Mark "*-setup.exe" and other such engines as 'invisible'?
[ ] DOOM-Crusher : Add PKE, EPK to recognised PK3 formats
[ ] DOSMAG : Use `KEY` functions to simplify shortcut-key handling?
[ ] DOOM-Crusher : fail on "SOUND&MUSIC.WAD"
[ ] Add engine compatibility checks for Windows version
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows XP
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows Vista?
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows 7
 -  [ ] test engines on Windows 8?
[ ] "SHELL" action improvements:
 -  [ ] add an action for launching files, rather than executing commands,
        i.e. verify the file exists before launching
 -  [ ] use `_DONTWAIT`
 -  [ ] change to the directory of the file being launched.
        this will do away with the need for "%~dp0" in "play.bat" files
[ ] Additional PortaDOOM.exe icon sizes: 20, 24, 48, 64, 96?, 128, 256
[X] Icon for launcher.exe
 -  [ ] extra sizes: 20, 96?
[ ] Need a "dotted tab" for contents and index pages
[ ] Consider right alignment from middle of line (rulers?), ">>"
[ ] Tabs in Warning Boxes are broken
[ ] Convert the statusbar/dialogue to a theme set
[ ] doom.bat : Cannot substitute IWADs when playing demos!
[ ] Inclusion of RETRES.WAD in onesies\dt-lutz should be before the PWAD.
    I.e. we need to control load order or have `/MOD` option or some-such
[ ] A more common location for "bloom.cfg", so it doesn't have to be copied
    everywhere?
[ ] "Shadow of the Wool Ball" and "Blade of Agony" are IWADs,
    so require own configuration (set defaults script, GZDoom 3.2+)
