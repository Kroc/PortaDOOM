17-JAN-18:
* QB64 upgraded to v1.2 -- improved compilation
* Re-instated blinking effect whilst keeping 30 rows (640x480)
* Slight re-organisation of code

28-DEC-17:
* Increased screen height to 30 rows (640x480), though this currently
  removes the blinking text ability (this may be restored later)

02-OCT-17:
+ Add "#" to usable key defines

30-SEP-17:
+ Linking between pages in the same set now more intelligently handles history.
  Pressing BKSP will return to the original page number, but navigating left or
  right to a different page will now forget the jump from a different page and
  BKSP will now take you out of the page-set

28-SEP-17:
+ Added themes! `$THEME=` & either "BLACK", "RED", "BLUE" or "GREY"

24-SEP-17:
+ Added `$TITLE=` & `$NAV=` page definitions to build a new bread crumb
+ Added `^R` right alignment (whole line)

17-SEP-17:
* Changed tabs to 4
* A tab will always cause a column sync, even if it only expands to one space
  (previously a tab that aligned to one space would not sync the column)
